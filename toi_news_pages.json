        "body": "While AIDS and related stigma might have been a sensitive issue, several international filmmakers have dealt with the topic beautifully. There are a number of films in which the emotions and social plight of people who are HIV positive have been portrayed well. A look at some of the films that were pathbreaking in dealing with the subject... Dallas Buyers Club (2013) Director: Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e After being diagnosed with AIDS, Ron Woodroof smuggles medication from Texas to distribute it to others with the condition, inviting the wrath of the system. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto won the Oscar for the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. The highly-acclaimed film also won several other awards for production at the Oscars. ALSO READ: \u200bJared Leto yet to watch 'Dallas Buyers Club' Yesterday (2004) Director: Darrell Roodt The South African film is about a young mother who discovers she has AIDS. Deserted by her husband, she wants to live only to see her daughter go to school. The film was nominated under the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards. Precious (2009) Director: Lee Daniels Based on the novel Push, the film stars Gabourey Sidibe, Mo\u2019Nique, Paula Patton and Mariah Carey. Sidibe plays Precious, who is impregnated by her father. She soon finds out he died of AIDS and she has also tested positive for HIV. But she doesn\u2019t let this affect her and continues to hope for the best. Pedro (2008) Director: Nick Oceano The film is about Pedro Zamora, a gay AIDS educator and television personality. It sketches the story of how Pedro actively participates in spreading awareness about AIDS and traces his life. Gia (1998) Director: Michael Cristofer Angelina Jolie\u2019s stunning portrayal of Gia catapulted her into the big league. The film traces the life of a real-life model who plummets into the dark world of drugs, wild lifestyle and contracts AIDS after an emotional crisis. It won several awards at the Golden Globe, Emmy and Screen Actors Guild. Philadelphia (1993) Director: Jonathan Demme The Tom Hanks-Denzel Washington-starrer is one of the first films to come to mind when you think of movies that deal with the topic of AIDS. It\u2019s about a man who gets fired by his law firm for testing positive for AIDS. He hires a homophobic, small-time lawyer to fight his case. One of the first mainstream Hollywood films to openly acknowledge HIV/AIDS, Hanks even won an Academy Award for his performance. Quick stats 35mn people were living with HIV globally at the end of 2013, according to estimates by WHO and UNAIDS. 2.1mn people who were newly infected with HIV globally at the end of 2013. 70% of the global total of new HIV infections are from sub-Saharan Africa. 60% reduction in chances of sexual transmission of HIV by male circumcision.

But she has already composed music for a short film, Nambinavar Keduvadhillai, as well as done chorus singing for a few films. Suchitra is an HIV positive teenager living in Anandha Illam, a special home for HIV-affected children in Tiruvallur district. She is not the only talented minor. Ten-year-old Bharathi from the same home has composed background score for a documentary film on new drugs for TB. There are several other students in the institute who nurse similar ambitions. Many of them from the home have provided chorus for film scores. Be it traditional carnatic ragas or western harmonies and symphonies, these children can handle it all. This is largely due to a compulsory music course introduced by the trustees of the home. \u201cWe provide weekly music classes with a Kollywood music director, Ravi Verma, who teaches them to play keyboard and drums as well as train them in carnatic and western music,\u201d said a campus administrator Muthupandian, as he pointed to a colourful and airy music room with several well maintained instruments. \u201cI have been coming here to teach music to these children for the last three years,\u201d said Ravi Verma, who has recently composed music for a Tamilmovie, Mayil Parai, which is slated to release next month. \u201cInstead of regular vocal music, I have been teaching them to approach music like a composer. It\u2019s wonderful to see the kind of compositions that they come up with. Generally, many people trained in music may be good at vocals or instruments, but cannot really compose as they have not been taught to think that way. These kids are getting an early advantage. They can read music too.\u201d Another 14-year-old, Anusha too has music directorial ambitions and has already done some chorus work. \u201cI recently did chorus work for the film Mayil Parai,\u201d she said. \u201cI am hoping to become a music director when I grow up.\u201d While many HIV positve children in other parts of the country live in poverty and remain neglected with no hope of a decent life, let alone professional success, children at the Anandha Illam are lively and hopeful of a good future. The campus too is well-equipped with airy and colourful classrooms and dormitories (Names of the children have been changed to protect their identities.)"

They are among the 130 thalassaemic children registered with Jodhpur\u2019s Marwar Thalassaemic Society, said a source. Terming it as a case of negligence, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the state government was responsible in the case. \u201cIt is a case of negligence. It is the responsibility of the state government to take proper precautions,\u201d Azad said in Srinagar. In the last one-and-a-half years, at least eight thalassaemic children in the city were found to be HIV positive while 46 others were infected by hepatitis B virus prompting a probe by the state government. In December 2008, five children tested positive for HIV and 29 for hepatitis C virus. In May 2010, three more children were found HIV positive and 17 suffered from hepatitis C. According to the Thalassaemic Society, if all the children who received blood transfusion are tested, the numbers may go up. Recently, members met the principal of S N Medical College and the divisional commissioner and demanded nucleic acid test at Umaid Hospital blood bank to prevent infection during transfusion. Medical college principal R K Aseri said a proposal for nucleic acid test \u2014 which is a more advanced blood test \u2014 has been sent to Rajasthan government which is now studying the expenses involved. The college has also formed a three-member committee to probe if there are any flaws in the blood bank's testing methods. The Society also demanded special consideration for families below poverty line and adequate staff and resources at Umaid Hospital's thalassaemia ward.Society secretary Vipin Gupta said, \u201cWe want the blood banks to have better technology.'' Currently, ELISA test has a longer window period, disabling it to detect any antibody at early stage in the donated blood.

In a recent research paper published in the Dr NTRUHS quarterly journal, it is said that despite having good knowledge regarding HIV, negative attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients are still prevalent among a large number of nursing students. \u201cThe stigma around HIV/AIDS in the medical community is not as severe now as it used to be a decade ago. However, the need to educate young nurses on the issue is made clear in the study,\u201d said Dr Samaram, sexologist and former national president of the Indian Medical Association. The study also revealed that over 60% of the students said they were worried about touching AIDS patients, despite knowing well that skin contact does not lead to the spread of the disease. Dr Samaram stressed that no doctor or nurse should deny treatment to an HIV patient as it is against medical ethics and human rights of the patients. \u201cThe precautions you take to treat HIV patients is not different from that of any other patient. The phobia around this should be driven away,\u201d he said. Dr Samaram also added that a patient need not reveal his HIV status to the nurse for treatment. Some students believed that the virus can be spread through mosquito bites and urine. Over 50% did not know that tattooing could cause HIV infections.

        "body": "KOZHIKODE: The pseudo stem, petiole and midrib of banana, which are usually abandoned to rot have helped the farmers in the district to script a success story in mushroom cultivation. The method is less expensive owing to the easy availability of residue and offers double the yield compared to the use of straw for mushroom production. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) Peruvannamoozhi, following the success of their first training in the use of banana crop residue, has started training more persons on the techniques. During the training programmes conducted the last two months the KVK stressed the use of banana crop residue along with the use of straw. \"Following the success of Satheesh Kumar, agri-entrepreneur from Kakkur panchayat we are stressing the use of banana crop residue for preparing mushroom beds,\" said Dr P Ratha Krishnan, programme coordinator of KVK. Mushroom cultivation assures household-level nutritional security and gives decent earnings with not much space and time. In order to boost this seasonal activity combined with the present banana harvesting season, KVK Peruvannamoozhi has trained over 500 people in the past couple of months, he added. Satheesh Kumar, who formerly was a photographer, is now a successful mushroom farmer as he ventured to depend on banana crop residue for preparing beds for mushroom cultivation. The man, who sells edible mushroom in the local market on a regular basis, prepares over 600 beds of mushroom simultaneously using pseudo stems and leaves of banana. The dried stems and leaves are collected from neighbouring localities for the purpose. \"Banana stems and leaves are easily available in rural areas and this makes the preparation of mushroom beds less expensive,\" said Satheesh Kumar. Moreover, the yield is almost double when we use banana crop residue for preparing mushroom beds compared to the yield when straw is used for preparing beds, he said. According to the farmer, who has been in mushroom production for one-and-a-half years, a bed prepared using 1 kilogram banana crop residue gives a yield of 1 to 1.5 kg or mushroom. The average yield when using straw, according to him, is 650 gram. Women and youth from Thamarasserry, Balusserry, Perambra, Vadakara, Naduvannur, Chempanoda, Peruvannamuzhi, Meppayur, Muthukadu, Panthirikkara, Poozhithode, Chakkittapara areas of Kozhikode district are given training by KVK. \"We are also imparting classes on the use of areca husk as a medium for preparing mushroom,\" said Dr Ratha Krishnan. Use of such easily available and less expensive material as alternatives is expected to improve mushroom production."

        "title": "India records 25% dip in new HIV infections",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: First the good news: globally there were more than half a million fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005, with India reporting a 25% dip in the rate of new HIV infections between 2001 and 2011. But even then last year alone, 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide. Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011. Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible. In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001. The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment. An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access. These are the findings of the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011. In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. \"The pace of progress is quickening \u2014 what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,\" said Michel Sidib\u00e9, executive director of UNAIDS. \"We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,\" he said. Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%. UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection. Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services. For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years\u2014ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment\u2014and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years. The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries \u2013\u2013 more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV. In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 \u2014 by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%). In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone. The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. \"It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,\" said Sidib\u00e9. \"I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,\" he added. The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005."

Police claim there at least 400 more \u2018sex parlours\u2019 operating in the city and their licenses can be cancelled once these are tracked down. Besides duping people, these parlours can trigger the spread of HIV, said a police officer officer. Delhi AIDS Control Society officials said approximately 22 per cent massage parlours in the city are potential hotbeds for HIV transmission. \u201cWe were getting frequent complaints from NGOs about such parlours and decided to investigate. We will now request National AIDS Control Organisation, Delhi police and the government to take swift action and sift fake parlours from genuine ones,\u2019\u2019 said a senior official. \u201cMost victims do not lodge complaints as they fear social ostracization. Parlour owners too change their phone numbers frequently and they keep shifting shop from one rented premise to another. We will now take a more holistic approach to the problem,\u2019\u2019 said a police officer. The crime branch is now scanning bank details of the accused, Rajesh Singh, in the fake friendship club racket. Police are also trying to establish if similar fake clubs are being run in other parts of the country. Singh is on the run and police suspect he could be operating more such clubs and masseur centres from other areas of west Delhi like Vikaspuri. \u201cIf we find the gang was operating across the city and the country, we could charge them under MCOCA,\u201d said a police officer. Police said this particular gang had been operating the racket for the past one year and was making over Rs 1.5 lakh every day by duping callers. The crime branch had on Saturday busted this gang in Janakpuri and arrested 25 people, including 20 women. Police said Singh was paying about Rs 75,000 rent every month for three offices in Janakpuri and had cheated people in several states, including, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In the case of friendship clubs, the caller would be asked to get himself registered by depositing Rs 1,000 in a bank account. Once the caller registers himself, he would be offered three categories of women contacts for being friends \u2014 models for Rs 7,000, college girls for Rs 5,000 and housewives for Rs 3,000. Once the amount was transferred by the caller, Singh would withdraw it using ATM cards and the women would stop taking the calls. For masseur training centres, they only entertained male callers. \u201cThey would be told that they would not only teach them how to become a masseur, but also provide a list of clients. The callers would be asked to pay Rs 1,000 as registration fee, Rs 3,750 for the massage kit and Rs 7,000 for the lady trainer,\u201d said Chand."

In Gujarat, 6,170 people were screened between January 2010 and September 2011 wherein 180 people tested positive. Of those who tested positive, 47.22% were below 30 years of age. In addition, 23% people were in 30-40 years of age group. Only 16% were between 40-50 years while 12.77% were above 50 years of age. Highest frequency was predictably in men as 64.44% of those who tasted positive were males while 34.44% were women. Only 1.12% of those detected positive were children. Chief of lab services of Metropolis Healthcare Dr Jatinder Bhatia said, \"Globally, the incidence of HIV that was rapidly increasing between 1990 and1996 has slowly declined between 1996 and 2010. Various treatment methods and awareness programs helped in controlling the disease by creating mass awareness, educating people about safe sex and ill effects of HIV infection. As per the recent data, the incidence of HIV is maximum in younger age groups i.e. 20-30 years which is a major concern.\" Dr Bhatia said rate of positivity out of the screened tests is less than 10 % in Mumbai and Gujarat but 30 - 40% at other places especially north."

Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds. \u201cSince my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,\u201d she recounted. Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it. \u201cI didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition. When I reminded the headmaster about the assurance, he pleaded helplessness as he was under pressure. No amount of reasoning helped,\u201d she said. Though Sujata did send him to school the following day, he was not allowed entry. Shaan has stayed home since. Sujata alleged that a school teacher even telephoned her and rebuked her for trying to questioning the headmaster's decision. \u201cNo one has any idea about HIV. When I tried to explain that other kids were not at threat, they refused to listen and remained adamant,\u201d she said. The ingorance is such that Shaan's grandmother, a Bengali teacher in the school, was forced to undergo blood tests and allowed to continue only after the results were negative. When TOI asked the headmaster why he had reneged on his assurance, Naskar did a U-turn and said that he hadn't shut the door on Shaan but had only informed his mother about the objections from other guardians. \u201cI want him to attend school but the parents are not sending him. But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,\u201d he said. On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees. District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. \u201cWhatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected. I will do whatever it takes to get him back to school,\u201d he said."

        "body": "JAIPUR: Rajasthan is highly vulnerable state in terms of spread of AIDS. Despite this, only 15% of the pregnant women received HIV test in 2010-11 to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child. The rest did not undergo the test due to social reasons. A survey conducted by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) shows that around 20 lakh women become pregnant in the state but only 15% of them receive HIV test. Around 3.02 lakh pregnant women took HIV test in the state out of which 362 women were tested positive, the survey shows. The state government in cooperation with the RSACS has provided various facilities under prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT), including free HIV test for pregnant women, counseling on antenatal care and sexually transmitted disease, providing nevirapine prophylaxis to mother and child for reducing HIV transmission from mother to child. Information, education and communication (IEC) joint director Pradeep Chaudhary, said, \"We cannot force pregnant women for HIV test as it is against human rights. But we try to persuade them to go for the test as it beneficial for their children. If pregnant women tested are positive, we try to reduce the chance of transmission of HIV to her child by up to 4% by giving nevirapine prophylaxis. A dose of navirapine is given to the mother at a time of delivery to prevent HIV transmission to the child.\" The state government aims that all pregnant women should undergo the test. Chaudhary said, \"There are some social reasons which desist pregnant women from undergoing the test.\" The state government has taken new initiatives which include opening of community-based HIV screening of pregnant women by Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery (ANM) at sub-centre level of A and B category districts like Ajmer, Alwar, Barmer, Ganganagar, Jaipur, Tonk and Udaipur. Also, the state government has opened 11 ICTCs which provide HIV DNA PCR test for early diagnosis of HIV infection in a child. But the positive sign is that pregnant women going for HIV test are increasing every year. In 2005-06 the figure was 2,771, in 2006-07 it increased to 19,037, in 2007-08 it was 89,150, in 2008-09 it was 1,40,429 and it was 2,52,591 in 2009-10."

        "title": "Act early to prevent AIDS",
        "body": "AIDS is a deadly disease caused by an infectious HIV virus that has killed millions of people all over the globe. HIV and AIDS strikes people from all backgrounds, gender and age. The only way to stay away from AIDS is to prevent it by adopting proper precautions, as there is no cure available. To help prevent the spread of HIV, Dr. Rina from Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, shares easy measures that can be easily incorporated in your life to prevent HIV and AIDS. Avoid multi sexual partners If you favour one night stands or you have multi sex partners, the chances of contracting HIV is high. Staying away from sexual activity involving contact with anyone\u2019s vaginal fluid or pre-seminal fluid is the best and most effective technique to avoid getting AIDS \u2013 says Dr. Rina. Educate yourself Some people feel HIV spreads through sharing food with HIV+ people. Get your facts about AIDS right \u2013 says Dr, Rina. HIV only spreads through transmission of certain bodily fluids carried by an infected person. Go deep and find out which bodily fluids could result in acquiring HIV. Lastly, understand its diagnosis. Though there is no cure available in the market, there are numerous modern medicines which help to slow down the development of AIDS and help the person live a comfortable life. Prevent HIV during pregnancy There are huge chances of transmitting the HIV virus from an HIV affected mother to the infant during delivery or breastfeeding. Hence, in order to keep your baby safe, get an HIV test done when you are pregnant. If tested positive, your doctor will prescribe anti-HIV drugs during pregnancy and delivery, which can reduce the risk of passing the virus to your baby. After delivery, choose formula milk or breast milk from an uninfected woman, advises Dr. Rina. Use a condom every time you have sex Dr Rina suggests that you use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Women can prefer female condoms to be on the safer side. If you are opting for oral sex, use a condom, dental dam or plastic wrap to prevent the infection from being transmitted. Check yourself regularly Get yourself tested regularly to check your AIDS status. This will help you prevent passing the infection to others and timely treatment can help you lead a healthy lifestyle. Hence, get yourself tested, whenever you have sex with a new partner. The test is easy and the reports will be available in a few days or as soon as 20 minutes. Avoid oily lubricants Dr Rina says \u2013 using an oil based lubricant will weaken the condom and increase the chances of transmitting the fluid. Hence use water based lubricants instead of oil based lubricants to stay safe. Avoid sharing needles Do not share needles with anyone, which includes illegal drug use or any prescribed drug use at home. Sharing needles will lead to coming in contact with someone else\u2019s blood, putting you at risk of the HIV infection. Health care practitioners should be cautious A healthcare facility is at a huge risk of receiving AIDS. Hence, be careful while dealing with needles and sharp instruments. Make sure to wear gloves, mask and other protective gear to avoid contact with the blood of anyone who is infected with HIV. Your personal items are only for you Avoid sharing any of your personal items like razors or toothbrushes with anyone. Your personal items can have traces of blood and sharing these items with any new person can lead to transmission of blood and putting you at risk of catching the infection.

A rally was flagged off from Ursula Hospital on Tuesday on the occasion of World AIDS Day to create awareness. District AIDS control officer, Dr A K Saxena said that awareness programme on HIV-AIDS had shown good results and the disease is declining in the city. Students from different colleges, holding banners and pamphlets with slogan 'AIDS hare ga-Manavta jeetege' and 'AIDS ka gyaan-Bacahega Jaan', took part in the rally. They also staged a street play through which message of unsafe sex was given. In the morning, a programme was held by Indian Medical Association (IMA) to create awareness among paramedical and nursing staff about AIDS. Doctors said that youth are vulnerable to HIV because early onset of maturity and late marriages are forcing them to indulge in unprotected physical relationships, which often lead to this dreaded disease."

        "body": "KOLHAPUR: The District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Kolhapur has identified as many as 18 preliminary HIV positive cases in the on-going 'gram samvedana', an awareness campaign being conducted across 65 villages from February 6. DAPCU programme officer Deepa Shipurkar said that as many as 12,000 screenings have been conducted in the last 11 days in the rural and remote areas of the district. Shipurkar said those cases, which have been tested positive, have to undergo further tests to get the accurate result. She added that these patients will be counselled at an integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) before starting any treatment. According to Shipurkar, Kolhapur district has 3-4 major industrial areas besides the textile business of Ichalkaranji. These industrial enterprises are major hubs of employment generation. People from at least 100km periphery migrate to Kolhapur in search of jobs, most of who are HIV positive. Another aspect unique to Kolhapur district is the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters from Marathwada, north Maharashtra and Karnataka between October and April. DAPCU conducts regular awareness campaigns and screenings to find out prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases among the sugarcane cutters, she said. At least one lakh people, mostly men, migrate to Kolhapur during the sugarcane cutting season. Previous reports have pointed out that unconventional working hours, heavy load, liquor consumption and unprotected sexual activity among a host of other factors others make them vulnerable to HIV. Shipurkar further said during Gam Samvedana, it has been found that people who travel to metro cities in search of work, contracted the virus there. She added all HIV positive patients should opt for Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) which they can avail at the four hospitals in the district. Patients are counselled at ICTCs before being administered treatment. After a range of blood tests, the patient whose CD4 count is less than 500, he has to take treatment throughout his life. However, the norm has been relaxed now. The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working. She added that it is a growing concern that the disease is more prevalent in the remote areas of the district. Awareness campaigns will be increased in the coming days."

The number of HIV cases has come down drastically in Dharwad in the past five years. From April 2008 to March 2009, 2,345 people were found to be HIV positive of 13,387 subjected to blood test to check HIV prevalence. The figure was alarming which put the health department in a tight spot and compelled it to take measures to control the spread of the disease in the district, which is known as the educational and cultural hub of North Karnataka, sources said. Blood samples of 18,860 people tested from April 1 to August, 31, 2013, it was found that only 567 people were infected with deadly disease in district, which brought much-needed relief to the health department particularly the Aids Prevention Society run by the government in district, Dr SM Honakeri, officer for district Aids prevention programme, told TOI. \"We are really happy that the number of HIV positive cases dropped in the district when compared to last year. Now, the HIV positive rate is 3.55% against the 4.25 to 5% last year. We will check the results every month and take steps to prevent further spread of the disease,\" he added. The number of HIV cases among pregnant women has also come down. \"When we tested the blood samples of 15,717 pregnant women, we found only 21 HIV positive cases this year. Overall, HIV positive percentage has come down to 3.55 from 17.5 in the past five years,\" he said. The Aids Prevention Society conducted various programmes to educate people. \"All programmes we implemented have brought positive results.

        "body": "TRICHY: What makes the life of a HIV infected person worse is not just the health condition, but the discrimination he or she is forced to face, be it by the family members or the society. But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women. Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in Trichy, who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them. Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. \"We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice. The HIV affected people can approach the legal aid centre for solving their problems. The legal aid centre functions on Tuesday and Friday,\" said advocate KAV Dinakaran, who has been dealing with such cases for the past two years. In some cases, the family of the husband is withholding the dowry given to the woman. Likewise, many people don't return the money borrowed from the HIV affected person after the death. Such cases have also been dealt. \"The families of the husband try to seize the property that should be given to his wife. I have come across some patients who were even denied to use the ration card by the family of her husband. The women, who are already upset after being infected by her husband, can not think of approaching the court. The legal aid centre in the ART centre is a boon for such people as it helps them to get their legal issues solved,\" A Thamil, network for positive people in Trichy, told TOI. Besides providing legal aid to HIV affected people, the legal aid centre also distributes to welfare schemes."

Neelnajana explains the phenomenon of a colour diet, \u201cIt has been increasingly recognised that lots of plant foods colours have main beneficial properties and these are called functional foods. Besides the nutritive value, these colours have pigments in them that work in many ways. Many of them have anti aging properties, anti-oxidants and help complete many beneficial reactions in the body.

Sources said that the department will take necessary action based on a report which it will get from the team in a day or two. The sources said that the department is working out a solution taking into consideration views from all stakeholders. Being a sensitive matter, the government doesn't want to make public the proposal for a solution fearing that it might go against the interest of the children, the sources said. A couple of meetings took place on Tuesday to resolve the issue. The government has involved bodies like Goa state aids control society to come out of the imbroglio. Confidentiality is also being maintained as parents of children studying in a Sulcorna school threatened to withdraw their wards en masse if the HIV+ children were admitted in the school. The Sulcorna school was in a fix as it had on humanitarian grounds decided to admit the children after two schools close to the children's home where they were housed, had reportedly refused to admit them. Though the education department was initially reluctant to intervene, officials went into a pro-active mode after the chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is also the education minister, stated that the government would not tolerate any discrimination. An official said that the government will ensure that the Supreme Court directions are implemented - that there is no discrimination to HIV children in getting admission to a neighbourhood school. A source said that the education department is also working on adopting some preventive steps so that such cases do not occur in the future. In March 2014, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and all states on a PIL to declare HIV-affected children as a disadvantaged group under Right to Education Act (RTE), to ensure that they get admission without any discrimination. The Goa state commission for protection of child rights as well as GSACS members have decided to meet the stakeholders. The former will also inquire into the leakage of information of the children who are HIV positive."

The PIL was filed by advocate Vijay Nangesh highlighting the \u201cimproper\u201d practice in G G Hospital in Jamnagar. The lawyer submitted that the patients infected with HIV are given a band to be tied on their heads so that others could identify them and keep distance from them. He also produced photographs of patients carrying tags of HIV on their heads. The petition claims that such a branding of HIV infected people is inhuman treatment to them, for this marking leads to isolation of these patients as other patients and their relatives maintain a \u201csafe distance\u201d from them. The petitioner also pointed out that this inhuman practice also causes panic among other patients who are in the hospital. The PIL cited a guideline given by the Supreme Court saying that the identity of such people must not be disclosed . The lawyer also cited rules framed by the Medical Council of India in this regard . The PIL has demanded immediate restriction on this practice of disclosing AIDS patients\u2019 identity. It has also sought action against responsible officials. After hearing the case, a bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala sought reply from the state health department secretary, Jamnagar collector and the medical superintendent of the GG Hospital. Further hearing on this issue is kept next week. Meanwhile, other PILs are also being heard by the HC on the issue of HIV infected people . The high court has ordered CBI probe in the incident of HIV infection among thallassemic kids in Junagadh ."

        "body": "SIRSA: A woman and her family members were allegedly shown the door by staff nurses at Sirsa civil hospital on Wednesday night, fearing that she was HIV positive. The woman had come for delivery; her family members alleged that the staff nurses took blood samples for tests and later informed her that she was HIV positive. The family alleged that the nurse then misbehaved with them and asked them to go to any other hospital. The woman's brother Sunil, a resident of Darbi village, alleged that the nurses misbehaved with his sister and other family members after the lab reports indicated that she was HIV positive. \"I asked for an ambulance from the staff, but they refused to provide us the vehicle. I took my sister on a motorcycle to get her blood tested again and after two tests in another laboratory, the result was HIV negative. I admitted her in a private hospital where she delivered a baby boy,\" he said. The in-charge of nursing staff of the civil hospital was not available for comments. Senior doctor Rita Banga said, \"I learned about the incident and informed the chief medical officer about it. We are not certain about any nurse or any class IV staff misbehaving with the woman and family members. An inquiry has been ordered by the CMO.\" Sirsa CMO Surender Nain said, \"Yes, the matter was brought to my knowledge. The woman's family met me. I have ordered a departmental inquiry into the matter and action will be taken against the guilty.\" Sirsa deputy commissioner Nikhil Gajraj said, \"I have directed the CMO to look into the matter.\""

        "body": "GUWAHATI: At least five persons, including a woman, in Assam's Darrang district tested HIV positive after they were transfused with blood donated by an HIV+ donor in a government hospital at different times in the last two years. The donor reportedly did not know until a month ago that he was HIV positive and that he had infected others as well. After the matter came to light, J Saharia, the in-charge of the blood bank at Mangaldai Civil Hospital, where the blood transfusion was done, said the man donated blood twice - in September 2012 and January 2013 - and both times tested negative for HIV. He also said that only two recipients, not five as reported, and the donor tested positive for HIV in recent tests. However, anti-HIV activist and an employee of the State AIDS Control Society, Jahnavi Goswami, who came to know of the incident about 10 days ago, said that five persons in all have been infected due to blood transfusions from this donor and there could be more. \"The woman, who is about 20 years old and the mother of a child, was given blood for pregnancy complications about 18 months ago at Mangaldai Civil Hospital. About six months later she had her blood tested for a skin problem, which is when she was found to be HIV+. She filed an RTI and found out the name of the donor. After this, we tried to get the names of all recipients of the donor. Apart from this woman, I have met another victim and have talked to three other victims on phone,\" she said."

The 45-year-old woman died on Monday. A three-member probe team, comprising director-in-chief (health services) Dr Surendra Prasad, Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS)'s project director Dr S K Sinha and an additional secretary-rank health official, visited the hospital on Tuesday and took statements of PMCH blood bank's chief medical officer Dr U P Singh and Dr J P Gupta, who was treating the woman, among others. \"We explained to them that the woman's potassium level had dropped too low and the BP was very high. She also required blood transfusion which couldn't happen. Because of these reasons, the patient couldn't be operated,\" hospital's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak told TOI. The woman's attendant, Babloo, on Monday alleged precious time was lost after she was admitted on Thursday. Her condition deteriorated with the passage of every day. Babloo also alleged harassment at the hands of blood bank officials, saying he was made to run in circles to donate replacement blood even though the state government has ordered not to seek replacement blood from HIV+ patients. After the woman's death on Monday, at least two HIV+ patients came forward, alleging apathy at the hands of the PMCH doctors. A 25-year-old from Barh has his bone below the knee fractured. \"It was plastered, but it didn't heal. I was referred to PMCH which, in turn, referred me to ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre,\" he said. Incidentally, ART centres are units which distribute medicines for slowing down the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Barh patient said he confronted the PMCH superintendent, asking how the ART centre would treat him. The superintendent on July 29 wrote on his prescription, \"The patient is already registered with the ART centre of Rajendra Memorial Research Institute since November 9, 2010. Presently the patient has developed distal tibia. (He) needs orthopaedic treatment and consultation. (He is) referred to ortho OPD for immediate treatment and needful.\" A medical officer of the ART centre also gave a similar observation. \"Still I am running from pillar to post. Every time I am asked to come on Tuesday and every time I am told the doctor concerned has not come,\" he alleged. Another patient of Basauri village of Bhojpur district is registered with the PMCH's ART centre since July 1, 2010. He says he had gone to the medicine department of the hospital for endoscopy, but was asked to go home when it was discovered he was HIV+. \"The nurse asked me to go wherever I wished and no one will take any action,\" he wrote to the PMCH superintendent on July 19, 2013. Almost two months on, his wait for endoscopy continues. BSACS' governing council member Gyan Ranjan said ART centres in the hospitals are not apathetic towards such patients. \"However if an HIV+ person goes to any department for treatment, s/he faces harassment. Most of such patients cannot afford private health facilities,\" he said."

Twenty-four children, suffering from thalassemia, were suspected to have been given HIV-infected blood during transfusion, of whom five developed infection and subsequently died. Last week, the CBI filed a closure report before a special CBI court stating that no criminal case was made out for culpable homicide against civil surgeon, officials of government blood bank and office-bearers of Sarvodaya Blood Bank. The HC had directed then Junagadh ASP Shobha Bhutda to conduct investigation in the matter after a public interest litigation was filed before it. Dissatisfied with the probe done by her, the HC handed over the investigation of the matter to the CBI and continued to monitor the case. The premier investigation agency of the country recently submitted a closure report in the matter before the special CBI court. It is expected to give a detailed report to the state government recommending departmental action against the civil surgeon and in charge pathologist of the government blood bank for lapses on their part. The CBI is likely to recommend action against Sarvodaya Blood Bank office-bearers for interfering in the functioning of the government blood bank."

The accused has also been slapped with one-and-half-year jail term and an additional fine of Rs 1,500 following the conviction in different provisions of the Medical Practitioners' Act. The verdict was announced on Thursday.

The incident had taken place at Ambala Deshmukh village in Narkhed. Ghorpade, who was supposed to marry within a fortnight, was told on March 1 that he was infected with HIV, by Wadnerkar of Renuka Pathology Laboratory in Narkhed. Unconfirmed reports say that Wadnerkar was also the owner of the lab. Though a Mumbai-based laboratory clarified the following day that the mandatory tests of HIV were negative for Ghorpade, Wadnerkar apparently held back the information.

        "body": "WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have mapped the most detailed images yet of the protein responsible for getting HIV into cells, paving way for a potential vaccine for AIDS. The new findings of the AIDS-causing virus's complex envelope, includes sites that future vaccines will try to mimic to elicit a protective immune response. Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College determined the first atomic-level structure of the tripartite HIV envelope protein?long considered one of the most difficult targets in structural biology and of great value for medical science. \"Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine,\" said Ian A Wilson, a senior author of the study. HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, currently infects about 34 million people globally, 10 per cent of whom are children, according to World Health Organisation estimates. Although antiviral drugs are now used to manage many HIV infections, especially in developed countries, scientists have long sought a vaccine that can prevent new infections and perhaps ultimately eradicate the virus from the human population. However, none of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection. This failure is due largely to the challenges posed by HIV's envelope protein, known to virologists as Env. Env's structure is so complex and delicate that scientists have had great difficulty obtaining the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it. \"It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it?s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,\" said biologist Andrew Ward. The research team was able to engineer a version of the Env trimer (three-component structure) that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, yet retains virtually all the structures found on native Env. Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the team was able to look at the new Env trimer. The X-ray crystallography study was the first ever of an Env trimer, and both methods resolved the trimer structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before. The data illuminated the complex process by which the Env trimer assembles and later undergoes radical shape changes during infection and clarified how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses, such as flu and Ebola. The findings are published in the journal Science Express."

On being informed about his HIV status, the shocked man goes into a state of acute depression and even attempts suicide. Concerned over his condition, his family took him to a psychiatrist. On the advice of the shrink, his family then took him to a government ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centre) for a HIV re-testing. This time, much to the relief of everyone, the man is found HIV negative. But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month. District medical and health officials said despite the government mandate of conducing three tests for confirming HIV positive cases, most private centres conduct a single test, which can be misleading as it is done without pre- and post-test counselling. \u201cThere have also been cases where people committed suicide or were taken ill after being declared HIV positive. Thanks to the single test carried out in most private centres for HIV testing, which often leads to wrong diagnosis,\u201d stated Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy). \u201cTo confirm whether a person is HIV positive, a series of three blood tests need to be done in half-an-hour, including Coombs, SD bioline and Sigma tests. There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, most private centres furnish reports after conducting a single test (Tri Dot test), which is not foolproof and people end up being declared HIV positive when they are not. Such wrong diagnosis can lead to disastrous consequences,\u201d said Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in HIV/AIDS. \u201cMoreover,patients are also not given pre-test and post-test counselling, which is an integral part of HIV testing. Triple drug ART regime is also skipped in some private centres and a single drug regime is given. Also, the private centres charge Rs 500 for this single test, which is done free-of-cost at the ICTCs and charge Rs 6000 for the ART drugs per month, which again is supplied to patients free of cost by the government. Monthly, on an average, around 10,000 HIV testing is done in government centres in the district besides the tests undertaken by private centres, which goes unrecorded,\u201d said Dr Ramesh. \u201cAnother challenge in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is that patients turn up at the last moment when they have no option but to be administered ART (anti-retroviral drugs). They visit quacks,\u201d added Dr Ramesh."

Health reasons prevented her from personally receiving the award but she told STOI from Portugal that she was humbled and touched that her work received recognition. She recalled the time when HIV/AIDS was still taboo and AIDS orphans were not even recognized in the state. \"There was a lot of ignorance surrounding the transmission of AIDS and nobody wanted to even touch aids orphans. It was an upstream battle,\" she told STOI.FXB was one of the first NGOs invited by the National AIDS control organization, part of the Indian ministry of health and family welfare and was also granted official status by the Indian government in 1999 to organize HIV and AIDS prevention activities in the slum areas around Jaipur city. Du Boisrouvray was instrumental in getting May 7 recognized as World AIDS Orphans Day after she presented UN secretary general Kofi Annan with two million signatures in support of the day.

Chavan raised the issue at a meeting called by state legislative assembly speaker Dilip Walse-Patil to discuss issues relating to the setting up of the Maharashtra Legislators' AIDS forum. Under the aegis of the forum each legislator will contribute Rs 1 lakh to the fight against AIDS. Walse-Patil said while legislators were meeting to discuss the expenditure of Rs 15 lakh, no questions were being asked of the AIDS agencies on how they were spending Rs 100 crore annually. For 2010-11 the agencies have received grant to the tune of Rs 126 crore. \"The entire show is being run by bureaucrats but the government has no information whatsoever,'' he said. Chavan said the government had a right to know how the heads of the agencies were appointed. The three agencies include the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) which works in Mumbai only, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) for the rest of Maharashtra and Avert, an agency that is funded by USAIDS. What has miffed the state government is the refusal of the agencies to be subjected to state scrutiny as they directly receive funds from the Centre and in the case of Avert from USAIDS. An audit of the three agencies done at the behest of Walse-Patil revealed that though a state apex committee was set up to monitor the AIDS programme, its last meeting was held in 2001. The audit also showed that Avert has no permission from the state government. \"No documents were available at the state government level on the establishment of Avert,'' reads the audit report. Smriti Acharya, project director, Avert, said the agency was set up through an agreement between the Indian government and USAID in 1999.. \"As per Avert's memorandum of association, the additional chief secretary (health), government of Maharashtra is the chairperson of the society,'' she said. The society, said Acharya, had submitted all relevant documents for scrutiny. \"We have also asked the National AIDS Control Organistation to provide any documents it may have on the issue. We are awaiting a reply,'' she said. The audit also revealed that when MSACS was set up in 1998 the state public health minister was not informed about the decision. The decision was taken at the secretary's level. Later the secretary did admit to it being an inadvertent error and assured that it would not be repeated. Health minister Suresh Shetty said unlike other states where there was a single agency to implement the AIDS programme, in Maharashtra there were multiple agencies. \"We may require two agencies, one exclusively for Mumbai. Also now that the forum has been set up, we want to ensure that the Rs 1 lakh contributed by each legislator is spent in her/his constituency and there is transparency,'' he said."

These reports consist of information about the number of medicines taken by the HIV positive people in the district, stock of the medicines available at the centre and people walking in for getting tested for STIS, among other data. \u201cWe have tried several democratic ways of getting the attention of the authorities to our problems. We have only been hearing that the money will come \u2018in the next few days\u2019 for the last eight months. We have also written letters to union minister Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and state health department, none of whom have given anything other than assurances,\u201d said Hemlata Lohave, project manager of the targeted intervention programme at Red Cross Society. She added that the government would be responsible if the HIV infection rose because of their inattention. This is bound to happen as not only are the awareness programmes for vulnerable population under threat but the People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are also not being catered to properly, said other activists."

In 2007, a total of 11,501 people were subjected to the blood test in the district out of which 1,860 tested positive for the virus. \"The positive cases have been on the decline since then. As many as 1,229 were found infected with the virus in 2011 when a total of 46,033 people took the HIV test. This number dropped significantly to 176 in 2015 (October-end) when 57,960 people were subjected to the test,\" said civil surgeon G M Gaikwad. This drop can be attributed to the awareness campaigns which have been conducted over the years. Also, better access to medical care has also resulted in more and more people taking the blood test and seeking timely medical help, doctors here said. Encouraged by the declining numbers, the health department is now focusing to root out the infection rate completely from the district. \"The health department is now focusing on the theme 'Getting to Zero', which means eradicating the infection completely in the district. This will also include stopping any kind of discrimination against HIV+ people,\" Gaikwad said. Meanwhile, a rally was taken out to mark the World AIDS Day in the city on Tuesday. The rally, which was inaugurated by the Aurangabad district public health department, started from Kranti Chowk and concluded at the Marathwada Sankrutik Mandal ground where the health officials addressed the gathering to educate people about HIV and AIDS. Students from various schools and colleges, government department officials and NGOs participated in the rally. Aurangabad Zilla Parishad health officer B T Jamadar, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation health officer Suhas Jagtap, diatrict TB officer Vivek Khatgaonkar and other health officials were also present. Urging people not to discriminate against HIV+ people, Gaikwad also listed out initiatives taken by the district AIDS prevention and control unit and the NGOs to help HIV+ patients. Mangesh Gaikwad, programme officer, Aurangabad district AIDS preventive and control unit, said awareness is the key to achieve an AIDS-free society. HIV+ cases in district: Year ---- Tested ---- Positive ---- % 2007 ---- 11,501 ---- 1,860 ---- 16.17 2008 ---- 17,030 ---- 1,676 ---- 9.84 2009 ---- 31,013 ---- 1,579 ---- 5.09 2010 ---- 47059 ---- 1,503 ---- 3.19 2011 ---- 46,033 ---- 1,229 ---- 2.67 2012 ---- 48,888 ---- 1,093 ---- 2.24 2013 ---- 59,729 ---- 881 ---- 1.47 2014 ---- 54,917 ---- 645 ---- 1.17 2015 --- 29,714 --- 176 --- 0.31"

The 2013 data showed that of 100 people who tested positive, 38% comprised males and 68% females and the 35-49 age-group remained the most vulnerable lot. And alarm bells are ringing due to the rise in sexually transmitted among youth, particularly in Bhopal and Indore and a spurt in drug use and sexual activity, an official with Madhya Pradesh AIDS Control Society said. \"We have identified 100 villages in Bhopal where we are finding high-risk groups and providing them with reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and HIV check ups. We have launched a similar project for sex workers in urban and semi-urban areas, MSM (men having sex with men) groups and drug users,\" the official said. The state is currently ranked 30th among 34 states and Union territories when it comes to HIV prevalence, as per HIV technical report of Government of India. Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society has kicked-started its National Aids Control phase 4, wherein the body would focus on expansion of service, treatment and testing by involving private sector hospitals and PSUs. Condoms for women is still not popularized and continues to be in the pilot stage in Indore and Dewas. Now, the AIDS control society is focussing on women sex workers and this will be expanded after observing acceptance and feasibility of these condoms. While these condoms are available at subsidized rates of Rs 4 to 5, the condoms are not easily available in commercial markets."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: India's ambitious HIV/AIDS Bill is unlikely to see the light of day soon. Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, while meeting a delegation of protestors seeking an early introduction of the HIV/AIDS Bill, refused to make any commitment on when the government would finalize and introduce it in Parliament. According to the delegates, the minister stated that the Bill should not have provisions for free treatment for all HIV patients. The chapter of treatment in the Bill provides for the provision of free of cost treatment to people living with HIV including second-line treatment, opportunistic infections and important diagnostic tests like viral load tests, which continue to be a huge problem. \"The chapter is vital and the government's refusal to include it in the Bill comes as a huge disappointment to people living with HIV,\" the delegates said. Around 200 HIV patients staged a protest in the capital on Monday, demanding that a Bill to protect the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament. At present, the Bill is with the health ministry. In August 2007, the HIV/AIDS Bill, prepared by the health ministry, was sent to the law ministry. In March 2010, the law ministry cleared the Bill. \"Since then, the Bill is pending with the health ministry,\" the protestors said. According to Ram Lakhan of Jagriti Network, \"It seems that the government is sleeping on it. It has been half a decade since the Bill was finalized by the health ministry. However, till date, the Bill has not been tabled in Parliament.\" Under the present HIV programme, though government is providing first-line and second-line antiretroviral treatment (ARVs) to people infected with HIV, treatment for opportunistic infections and important diagnostic tests like viral load tests are not available at the government centres. \"The Bill is very important as it puts an obligation on the state to provide complete treatment including ARVs, diagnostics and nutritional supplements to all HIV positive people. However, it seems that this legislation is no more a priority for the government and they are not bothered about the problems faced by the people living with HIV in this country\" said Sahil from Om Prakash Network of Positive People. Jyoti, of the Delhi Positive Women's Network and Mundrika of Delhi Mahila Samiti, said, \"Women are specifically vulnerable to HIV due to their socio-economic status. The Bill aims to tackle this vulnerability by providing special provisions like protocols for sexual assault and right to residence. The Bill needs to be passed in the Parliament without any further delay.\""

        "body": "PUNE: A study undertaken by the D Y Patil Medical College, Pimpri, has found that the children of sex workers are relatively well informed about HIV, causing decreased immunity and its spread through unsafe sex. However, the study underlines the fact that the children have very little awareness about the transmission of HIV through other routes like infected syringes, needles etc. This, researchers say, is an important gray area that needs to be addressed. \"The environment in which the children of sex workers live exposes them to drug pushers, drug peddlers and the sharing of needles for injecting drugs. These are potential risk factors for the transmission of HIV infection. The study assumes significance as the thrust has always been only on creating awareness on avoiding transmission through unprotected sex,\" said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, professor and head of the department of paediatrics at the D Y Patil Medical College under whose guidance the study was carried out. The study, undertaken by paediatrician Sampada Tambolkar and Aishani Shah, a third-year MBBS student was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It was carried out between June and September last year and published in the Australian Medical Journal in June 2010. \"The objective of the study was to assess knowledge, attitude and practices of adolescent students of commercial sex workers in relation to HIV/AIDS and give recommendations about important issues identified during the study,\" said Tambolkar. Adolescent children in the age group of 10 to 15 years were selected for the study. They were given a pre-standardised questionnaire in which they had to answer the questions. Their anonymity was assured. The questionnaire was translated into Marathi by experts, for students. \"There were 36 girls and 14 boys who took part in the study. It was a descriptive study and there were no comparisons. The main point that emerged was the lack of knowledge about the spread of HIV and the means of acquiring the infection,\" said Shah. \"The social status of commercial sex workers widely affects their children. These children are exposed to the problems from a very young age and it is important to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS among them,\" said Tambolkar . \"The particular adolescent age group was chosen because they are largely exposed to unsafe sex and also to other potentially dangerous objects of transmitting infection like infected syringes, needles etc.\" Sharing other important findings, she said, \"The general awareness on the physical aspects of growing up among them was good. However, awareness about menstrual issues was poor though most of the participants in the study were females.\" \"The knowledge of ante-natal care (medical care of women during pregnancy) and its benefits were not adequately known. Awareness about teenage pregnancy and its hazards was good. They were relatively well informed about HIV causing decreased immunity and its spread by unsafe sex but they were ignorant about its spread by infected syringes, needles etc. This is important as these children may be exposed to such things due to the environment in which they live,\" said Shah. The researchers found that the attitude towards females was not very encouraging. \"A majority of the children thought that major decisions in the family need to be taken by the male members. Only 14% felt that it was incorrect to proceed with antenatal sex detection and most felt that trying cigarette once would not lead to addiction,\" said Tambolkar."

When informed by TOI, the Howrah chief medical officer (health) expressed shock over the incident and said that he would get her admitted on Wednesday. On November 8, Babita Dolui (name changed), a resident of Ramrajatala, was travelling on a bicycle with her husband on Kona Expressway.

The police rushed her to Howrah District Hospital. \u201cShe was semi-conscious when she was taken to the hospital.

        "body": "NAGPUR: Over four hundred contractual workers from nine NGOs running fifteen different projects in city for the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) have not got their salaries from last eight months. Besides not releasing the salaries, MSACS has asked the NGOs for curtailing staff by almost 50% from back date (April 2017 onwards) without issuing any retrenchment warnings or notices. The NGOs are on warpath and are planning to register their opposition to this on Wednesday with a joint protest. \u201cThis is not the situation with just Nagpur. About 3,500 persons from the 157 projects in the state have not got the salaries for last eight months. Since authorities have been continually assuring that the salaries would come soon for all this period, many workers have borrowed money, mortgaged their gold etc to run the families. And now all of a sudden, the authorities are asking us to reduce the staff. Since no one has got the salary and everyone has been working all this while, whom do the project officers throw out,\u201d said Nikunj Joshi, CEO of Sarathi project. Hemlata Lohave, project in charge from the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), says that reducing the staff would double the job of the existing workers. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is promoting zero deaths due to AIDS. \u201cHow will this be possible with such drastic curtailment of staff? The staff reduction has come to us as a surprise. No one is prepared for it. NGOs were not taken into confidence while planning the Annual Action Plan (AAP) and now they have laid new targets under the AAP. This is simply not acceptable. As per the contract both parties are expected to give one month\u2019s notice before removing from job or leaving the job,\u201d she said. Nanda Adamane, project head of the Bhartiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh, told TOI that it was very difficult on the organization\u2019s front to throw out workers without paying their salaries. \u201cRetrenchment would also mean doubling of target population under each worker. This is physically not feasible,\u201d she said. The MSACS joint director Lokesh Gabhane admitting certain flaws in the system however told TOI that the salaries from December 2016 to march 2017 had not been given as MSACS didn\u2019t get the required funds from NACO. \u201cWe understand the problem of the workers. MSACS has been in touch with NAC. Actually the AAP was finalized in June this year and hence the delay in release of salaries for the financial year 2017-18. We can expect the release of funds in another few days. Hence we are telling the NGOs to first pay the workers first whom they plan to retrench from the money that has been released for April to July. No one will be thrown out without wages. The remaining staff will have to bear with the delay but they too will surely get the salaries after NACO releases the funds,\u201d Gabhane told TOI. Gabhane said that NGOs will have to retrench staff based on their performance. \u201cThe reduction is staff is just 10-20%. The NGOs are exaggerating it to 50%. But this is true that they will have to reduce some staff from each project,\u201d he said."

At a camp organised in the outpatient department of GSVM medical college, Dr Navneet Kumar, principal of the college said that globally around 3.5 crore people are suffering from the the deadly virus, out of which Uttar Pradesh contributes to 1,60,000 patients. \u201cEvery year about 27 lakh new people are added to the list of sufferers all around the world. To cater to the needs of such patients, government has come with a lot of schemes. The medicines and treatment is available for free at the Antiretroviral therapy (ART) Centre situated in the city.

Meanwhile, District Tuberculosis Control (DTC) centre also organised various activities to mark the day. An inter-college \u2018Street lay\u2019 competition was organised to spread awareness among the youngsters as well to the society. \u201cHIV/AIDS sufferers are at high risk of developing TB. Therefore, it is important that they know about the precautions that should be taken to prevent the disease. Our main motive behind organising the competition was to create awareness among the youth\u201d, Dr. Anil Kumar Saxena, DTO, said. Local NGOs also came forward in making the society aware about the preventive measures to be taken to check the spread of the disease. An Etawah based NGO took out a rally from DTO office at Parade area to Ursula Hospital. A signature campaign was also organised by the NGO at LLR hospital premises.

According to recent data from the Union ministry of health and family welfare, 1,330 pregnant women of the nearly seven lakh carrying mothers screened in AP last year, tested HIV positive. The ministry data shows that in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where a larger number of women were screened, the percentage of women testing positive was significantly lower. It has been estimated that a mother has 30 per cent chance of transmitting the virus to her baby during pregnancy. The mortality rate among children with HIV is much higher compared to adults owing to their under-developed immune systems. However AP fared better or equally well in treating mothers to prevent transmission to children, as evinced by the data which shows that 1,142 HIV positive pregnant women were put on treatment. To reduce the numbers of baby transmissions, AP government in a first launched a new regimen of medication and treatment modality in 2012. The new treatment modality requires mothers to start treatment 14 weeks into pregnancy as against earlier practice of taking medication at the time of delivery. The medication now comprises a combination of three drugs as against one compound that was given earlier. Babies now are also given the same medication after birth. Additionally, under the new treatment practice, babies are screened every six months after birth until 18 months of age, when a concluding diagnosis is made about their infection. According to P L Jayachandra Reddy, additional project director of AP State Aids Control Society, more than 90 per cent of the first batch of pregnant women in undivided AP, who were put on the new treatment modality in 2012, delivered babies without infecting them. \u201cThe transmission rate has come down to about five per cent. It has not been eliminated completely owing to drug resistance some of the women developed during treatment or due to delay in starting the treatment,\u201d Reddy said. A team comprising members of World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) established this during a study of AP\u2019s implementation of the new treatment modality in March this year, 18 months after the first batch of women mentioned by Reddy, gave birth. Buoyed by AP\u2019s success, the WHO-NACO team has recommended that the new treatment modality be taken up in other states. The data was released by Union ministry of health 1,330 pregnant women of the nearly seven lakh carrying mothers screened in undivided Andhra Pradesh last year, tested HIV positive, which is much higher than in other states"

Now, it is estimated that these paintings would be sold for about Rs 2 crore, which would be donated for the children living with HIV/AIDS,\" president of the exhibition's committee,\" Brijesh Dubey, said, adding that proceeds from the sale would go towards construction of a house for the such children. Among the noted painters and photojournalists who have donated their works, included Raghu Rai, Ashish Poddar, Jatin Das, Himmat Shah, Manu Pareek, Anoop Kamath, Bikash Poddar, Ashit Paul, Ritu Kamat and Sanjay Bhattacharya. Raghu Rai, who was in the city on the occasion said, \"We have done whatever we could do by donating our works with an aim to construct a house for children living with HIV/AIDS.\" More than 100 children living with HIV/AIDS also gathered in the city to celebrate Human Rights Day. They took part in drawing competition organized on the Rajasthan University campus. Earlier in the morning, the children took out a rally in the city with an aim to make people aware that the children living with HIV/AIDS are just like any ordinary normal children who should not be discriminated and they have their own rights."

        "body": "Kolhapur: City-based NGO Lotus Medical Foundation, which has been working for HIV+ patients, on Friday organized a wellness drive in the city to boost the confidence among the children. Around 50 children participated in the drive along with their parents and caretakers. Kimaya Shah, managing trustee of the foundation, said, \"The daylong drive was mainly to keep a track of our patients, beneficiaries and boost their confidence by treating them like normal people. A small scale baby-wellness competition was part of the drive. Another message we wanted to spread among the parents and caretakers was though some of children are HIV+, they can live a normal life. Unlike other diseases, the fear of death among AIDS patients is high. Another fear prevalent among the patients is that they could easily succumb to other infections.\" She said though the foundation did not wish to compromise on the secrecy of the patients, it also wanted to boost their confidence. The organizers had divided the participating children into three age groups - six to 18 months, 18 to 36 months and 36 to 60 months. Their medical tests along with weight and height was checked. An awareness lecture on healthy diet, medication and its gradual results was also organized during the drive. Deepa Shipurkar, district AIDS prevention and control unit programme officer, said, \"The participating women and children are mainly from 3-4 tehsils in Kolhapur district, where the prevalence of such patients is higher. A lot of industrial activities take place in these tehsils, which have significant floating population.\""

        "title": "Four of 10 HIV+ newborns may miss timely treatment: Study",
        "body": "MUMBAI: Four out of 10 HIV-positive newborns in the city could be missing out on timely treatment as their parents fail to return for a confirmatory diagnosis. Failure to detect and treat HIV early may not just cause irreversible neurological damages, but also prove fatal for babies. Doctors at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recently discovered the worrying trend while analyzing data of 1,410 babies who were tested for HIV between 2015 and 2018 at the reference laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. At six weeks of birth, infants born to HIV-infected mothers are subjected to the first test, which if positive, is repeated immediately. This second test assumes great significance as the child is immediately started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), if this report too comes positive. The study showed that merely 61% of parents returned for the second confirmatory test. \u201cWe were surprised to see that so many parents are missing out on the second visit, thereby delaying the child\u2019s treatment,\u201d said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular lab at Kasturba that receives samples from 36 HIV testing and counselling centres across the city. The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. \u201cSuch a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,\u201d she said. Nair hospital\u2019s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. \u201cIn 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it\u2019s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,\u201d said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found. The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. \u201cCounselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,\u201d said a doctor from Sion hospital\u2019s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. \u201cBottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby\u2019s bloodstream.\u201d Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult. But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi\u2019s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it\u2019s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. \u201cThe first three years of a child\u2019s life is when maximum growth happens. If the virus is not controlled, damages like stunting of height, weight and developmental milestones could be permanent.\u201d"

Every time police cornered Manoj (name changed), an HIV-positive vehicle thief, he showed them his HIV status certificate and escaped after threatening to infect them with a bite. But late last month his luck ran out when he was caught along with his partner Raj Kumar on the way to Meerut. Police say the duo was involved in around 50 cases of vehicle theft and robbery. Their arrest came about as the car they had stolen was equipped with a GPS tracking system. On the morning of August 23, a woman from Saket in south Delhi reported the theft of her Santro car. Inspector Rituraj, whom DCP south PS Kushwah had put in charge of a team to catch vehicle thieves, used her mobile phone to locate the car. The car was in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad at the time. Immediately, a police team accompanied by the woman set off to seize it. When they reached Kaushambi, the accused fled towards Meerut. However, police continued pursuing them and stopped the car as it crossed Ghaziabad. As police surrounded the car and asked the duo to get out, Manoj resorted to his old trick and threatened to bite them. However, the woman distracted him in a conversation and two policemen reached from behind, threw a towel over his face and tied it up, a source said. His hands were also tied up and he was brought back to the police station. A case was registered and the duo was arrested. Both men are in their 50s and live in the Dakshinpuri area of south Delhi, a source said. With their arrest, police claim to have solved around 22 cases of vehicle theft and recovered four cars and two bikes. Investigation is continuing. Police have also informed the jail authorities about the accused and his behavioral pattern. A source said Manoj will be kept separated from the other prisoners in jail."

Dr Sreelatha P R, pediatrics department, MCH said that the girl died of leukemia. \u201cShe was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday and her condition was very serious,\u201d the doctor said. The girl\u2019s father said she was taken to the RCC after the doctors at the MCH diagnosed her with leukemia in February, 2017. The treatment for leukemia began on March 1, 2017. While she was under treatment at RCC the girl underwent blood transfusion several times. The girl was tested positive for HIV in August, 2017. \u201cOn October 5, our child was taken to a lab in Chennai for a detailed HIV test. However, the lab report said she was not HIV positive. The doctors at RCC said it was not a final report and they can confirm the presence of HIV only after getting a report from Delhi. But the doctors have not given that report us till date,\u201d he said. The girl\u2019s father said she was discharged from the RCC on November 1last year. \u201cAfter that she was never taken to the RCC. We followed ayurveda treatment. But it did not work her. She was under the treatment of doctors at Alappuzha MCH. On Wednesday, her condition became serious and we took her to the MCH. But she died,'' he said. The funeral will be held on Thursday. Dr Ramesh R, project director of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), said the blood samples of the girl were tested in the lab of General Hospital, Tambaram in Chennai but the lab could not find viral load in her blood samples. \u201cWe forwarded the report to National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). They did not advice treatment for HIV as the Chennai lab could not find viral load. We were planning to conduct a repeat HIV test on her in CMC Vellore after some months,'' he said. The Medical College police in Thiruvananthapuram in September 2017 had registered case and launched a probe after receiving a complaint from the girl's parents in this regard. The KSACS, which conducted a probe into the incident, has given a clean chit to the RCC authorities and the report of the KSACS said that the blood given to the nine-yearold girl during transfusion at RCC in Thiruvananthapuram was tested before the procedure and HIV was not detected. Report of KSACS however pointed out that RCC was not equipped to detect the virus during the window period. Read this story in Bengali"

        "body": "CHENNAI: Southern Railway has started demolishing cement fences which are constructed beside the railway tracks on the Chennai Beach-Chengalpet section. On Monday, a wall at Palavanthangal railway station was demolished by railway engineers. Though this was done to ensure safety of foot-board travellers, this has enabled commuters at the station to jaywalk across the track, which is another safety risk. The removal of the walls was after an accident at St Thomas Mount railway station last week, when 10 commuters travelling foot-board on a suburban train fell down on the track after hitting a cement fence on platform number 3. Five died, while the rest were grievously injured. Railway officials maintained that the cement fence was within safety parameters and the incident happened because commuters were travelling footboard. When TOI visited the spot during an inspection, there was hardly a foot\u2019s distance between the coach entrance and the wall. The Railway Claims Tribunal too said that commuters were forced to travel on footboard during peak hours, which caused the accident. Last week officials in Chennai division conducted extensive surveys to check what kind of fences were near tracks at various suburban stations, which might hit footboard travellers. \u201cWe have demolished walls at Saidapet and Meenambakkam station. All three stations are those where \u2018fast\u2019 locals don\u2019t stop,\u201d said a senior railway official. However, the official maintained that these structures were within safety parameters. Retired railway officials have pointed out how designs should now be made taking extra safety clearances in mind, due to the huge rush in suburban sections."

The court rejected clean chit to all concerned authorities given by the probe agency. The court granted 60-day time to the central agency to complete further probe on specific issues and submit the report. Expressing dissatisfaction over CBI's closure report by terming it 'incomplete', the court said that it was necessary to get the issue probed further. The court said that the Gujarat high court had transferred the probe to CBI to get this subject investigated in minute detail. \"It is necessary to probe the issue further. It could lead to the root of the matter and clarify on who are the responsible persons,\" the court said. Last year, CBI had filed a closure report by giving clean chit to Mahendra Mashroo, local BJP MLA, who runs Sarvodaya Blood Bank from where the blood was sourced by the government hospital, for transfusion into the thalassaemic children. Blood transfusion also took place there. However, it was later revealed that the thalassaemic children were HIV positive and several of them had passed away since 2011. Parents of 34 such thalassaemic kids fought a long legal battle and finally sought further probe after CBI filed a closure report claiming that there could be various reasons behind the thalassaemic kids contracting HIV. The court agreed with arguments put forth by their counsel Paresh Waghela in case of three girls, who got treatment only at Junagadh civil hospital and obtained blood from Sarvodaya Blood Bank.ed on how they keep tested blood units with those bottles that are not tested. Though CBI probe concluded that there was negligence in this case and not criminal intention, then responsibility could have been fixed easily, the lawyer had submitted."

I had lost interest in life after being deserted by my ex-husband for my HIV status. I had never imagined life can start afresh,\" said the 23-year-old bride from Khurda district. The woman's earlier marital life was shattered after she contracted HIV. She had undergone the test at Capital Hospital in April, 2012 when her infant daughter's intermittent fever didn't subside. When she tested positive, her then husband abandoned her and their daughter at the hospital bed. \"The baby died within a few days and we got divorced,\" the woman said. She had been given two units of blood at Khurda district hospital in 2011, which seems to be the source of her HIV. \"I have moved on after the initial days of frustration,\" said the newlywed who works for an HIV/AIDS project. The groom, who works as a contractor, looked equally elated. \"I am very happy to have got such a life partner. I was earlier apprehensive about my disease after I tested positive around one and half years ago,\" said the 31-year-old groom from Angul district, minutes after the couple took the marriage vows and performed Vedic rituals at a temple. \"My family and well wishers have been very supportive of the marriage,\" he said. Both the man and wife are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the medication HIV+ people get when their CD+ (a blood cell) count becomes low. Kalinga Network of Positive People, an organization of HIV+, played the matchmaker. \"We knew the woman from the time she was deserted by her husband and also the man for past around a year.

There\u2019s her glamorous Basic Instinct avatar that catapulted her to fame, and there\u2019s her philanthropic side \u2013 the one that has her campaigning for Tibetan rights, fighting against AIDS as amfAR\u2019s Global Fundraising Chair and, more recently, saw her honoured with a Peace Summit award in Warsaw. It\u2019s the latter side that Stone divulges in an interview ahead of her first visit to India, where she\u2019ll take part in the country\u2019s first amfAR gala that will be co-chaired by Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan, and see a performance by Ke$ha. \u201cIndia has an enormous amount of AIDS awareness,\u201d she says, when asked for the reason behind introducing the gala to India, adding, \u201cSome countries that I go to are still trying to deny that it\u2019s happening. In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV AIDS. India manufactures most of the drugs that are used to cure HIV around the world, which is an amazing, amazing fact that most people don\u2019t know. Fifty percent of the people who need treatment in India still don\u2019t have access to these drugs. We need to try to remedy this because we are in a situation that just education and awareness can help remedy. Because you\u2019re a country that\u2019s manufacturing the life-saving drugs.\u201d But India\u2019s still among the countries that don\u2019t like to discuss sex openly, and that might be an impediment to spreading AIDS awareness? Stone says, \u201cWe can\u2019t be born unless people have sex. So, whether it\u2019s a taboo word or not, it is the reality of what is occurring everyday, and it\u2019s a loving reality, it is a family reality. In fact, it\u2019s archaic not to say (the word). You can\u2019t not say penicillin if there\u2019s a flu outbreak. It\u2019s illogical, it\u2019s unhelpful, and it\u2019s out of reality. So, whether you want to call it sex or reality or family, you respectfully \u2013 in your culture \u2013 can call it what you want, but that\u2019s what is happening. And there were, in fact, 1,32,000 infections last year, and we know that congratulations to you and your country, for having such spectacular accounting. But to be mature, to be scientific, to be loving, we need to be thoughtful about treating people and we must be thoughtful about what we\u2019re treating. You can\u2019t treat breast cancer if you can\u2019t say breast and if women can\u2019t get their breasts examined. We must have safe places where people can discuss and be treated. Forty-four million people are already dead from AIDS. What logic is there in not discussing the word?\u201d About the gala, that\u2019s an annual fixture in Cannes and Milan, where Hollywood\u2019s who\u2019s who make for pretty photo-ops in their finest evening wear, Stone says, \u201cWhat we do, and what we\u2019re planning to do in India, is to come to your country specifically, to partner with all the HIV work you\u2019ve been doing. The proceeds from amfAR go directly to scientific research. So, what we are looking for is a cure and a vaccine. When we do these benefits we have some parties around it, where we all get to know each other, and in the evening, we come to a common agreement that what we are going to do is have a great time doing a great thing. People generously bid on the auction items (this year\u2019s lineup includes a trip to the Maldives, an Andy Warhol painting, Herb Ritts\u2019 photograph of Madonna), knowing that the money that they give will go to scientific research and grants.\u201d"

        "title": "HIV 10 times more prevalent among migrants than general population",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: Migration is fuelling India\u2019s HIV epidemic. National AIDS Control Organisation\u2019s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants \u2014 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population. With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) \u2014 a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations \u2013 which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country\u2019s anti-HIV fight. Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it\u2019s year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations. Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, \u201cMigrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.\u201d NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations. Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors \u2014 Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai \u2014 threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average. According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities. In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of HIV transmission. A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months. For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick. A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the women and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband. RRE has been recognized as the world\u2019s largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities. Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services. Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed."

        "body": "PATNA: Today is the silver jubilee of World AIDS Day. The first World AIDS day was celebrated 25 years ago. As we celebrate World AIDS Day, there is some good news to report: the rate of HIV infection is declining! Worldwide, 2.3 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2012, down from 3.4 million in 2001. However, there are still an alarming number of people, 35.3 million, living with HIV. Twenty-five years since the first World AIDS Day, the world has made incredible progress in the fight against AIDS. Much has been achieved in recent years, and leaders from around the world have begun to call for the achievement of \"the beginning of the end of AIDS\"- something that would have seemed impossible a decade ago. But achieving the beginning of the end of AIDS won't happen just by repeating the phrase enough times - it takes hard work, political commitment and new resources. Securing more money for HIV/AIDS, however, is only one piece of the broader effort to end the disease. In order to develop a sustainable response to the epidemic, political leadership at the national and local levels is essential. For the past several years, on this particular day of the year, the international reflects upon a theme. This year it's 'Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths' on the occasion of World AIDS Day. Today, the candles will be lit and pious words will be mouthed as well. A quarter of a century after HIV/AIDS was recognized as a pandemic with multiple dimensions, certain leaders continue to beat that old whipping horse, alternative lifestyles. Even as globally more and more progressive nations are giving same-sex couples legal marital status, there are homophobic demagogues who try to link HIV infections to a LGBT. A recent statement from CARITAS, which on one hand talks about the 'compassion' of the Catholic church towards those living with the virus, also states that the goal of 'Zero new HIV infections' can be attained through 'responsible interpersonal relationships' and individual behaviour, including the limitation of sexual activity to a 'permanent and mutually faithful' marriage between 'one man and one woman' and the 'avoidance of all injecting drug use that has not been prescribed and supervised by healthcare professionals'. In India, the AIDS pandemic brought along with it liberation of sorts. The fact that India and small town India in particular had significant numbers of non-heterosexual people, brought to the fore the ugliness of discriminatory laws such as IPC 377. The fight by some NGOs to ensure that equitable and compassionate access to treatment also reached the panthi, kothi, hijra and kinnar communities, ultimately led to a reading down of the law. The LGBT community in India got a voice and a visibility, thanks to the AIDS pandemic. The government and the authorities could no longer pretend that non-heterosexual people didn't exist in India. In Bihar, there are several concerns that need to be addressed, not the least being the one that deals with blatant discrimination against positive persons, a blatant carelessness with blood products in certain blood banks and the blatant flouting of loopholes that allow certain unregistered establishments to continue to peddle unsafe blood under the radar, points out Sanjeet Singh, an HIV positive activist who uses public interest litigations to have the high court nudge the lethargic medical services into action. The HIV positive kids in Bihar now have access to a scheme that provides for their sustenance. The government has been particularly mindful that HIV positive persons below the poverty line should not be denied entitlements such as Indira Awas and so on. It's still a long haul, but with more and more awareness about HIV and treatment spreading, discrimination and stigma will also shrink, and Bihar's women will be a key factor of change, says social worker Shantwana Bharati from Bihar Mahila Samakhya Society. There are several instances in her book of case studies where simple village women have advocated successfully and curtailed acts of intolerance towards people living with HIV. So, everyone hopes to see new infections going down and better access to treatment for infected people over the next few years. But there's a long way to go. On a political level, our leaders can do much more to ensure that the HIV/AIDS responses are more effective, equitable and free of stigma. Tackling AIDS, particularly among marginalized populations, will in some cases require a sea-change in how these populations are viewed and treated. High-level political endorsement will be critical to ensuring access to services for all."

        "body": "BANGALORE: The high court has come to the rescue of an HIV-infected man who was allegedly stopped from working by a company. The court on Wednesday ordered his reinstatement with 50% back wages in two weeks. The writ appeal by Narayanappa, 51, was allowed by a division bench headed by Justice KL Manjunath. The bench noted that Msrs Stride Arco Lab Limited, a tablet manufacturing company and an export-oriented unit, refused employment to the son of the appellant (Narayanappa) as an alternative measure. Narayanappa claimed that refusal of employment to HIV-infected persons goes against the national policy. Narayanappa, who is said to have sold two acres of his land for the company to set up its plant at Suragajakkanahalli village, Anekal taluk in Bangalore Urban district, was offered a job in the maintenance department in August 1998, with a salary of Rs 2,050 per month. However, from October 3, 1999, he wasn't given the job after a medical examination revealed he'd tested positive for HIV. The company claimed Narayanappa voluntarily stopped coming to work after he came to know about the medical condition. Narayanappa's plea before the labour court was dismissed on October 20, 2010, on the ground of delay as he had sent a notice to the company only in July 2003, after four-and-a-half years. The single bench dismissed his petition saying he had failed to explain the delay. NICE plea against TJ Abraham referred to CJ NICE company, the BMIC project proponent, filed an application seeking initiation of suo motu contempt of court action against activist TJ Abraham, who is also a complainant before the special Lokayukta court. Justice H Billappa referred the application seeking contempt-of-court action, the memo filed by Abraham and NICE objections, before the Chief Justice for further orders. The company has claimed that the memo filed by Abraham is irresponsible, causing harm to the institution and administration of justice, and also aimed at scandalizing and lowering the court's authority. Govt says land alienated in favour of ex-minister A division bench headed by Chief Justice DH Waghela has directed the authorities to maintain status quo on 38 acres 26 guntas land at Basavanapura, KR Hobli, near the old airport. This was after the government filed a statement that portions of these lands, classified as government ones, are alienated in favour of former minister A Krishnappa. BDA chief asked to file affidavit A division bench headed by KL Manjunath has directed the BDA commissioner to file an affidavit on the action taken over land acquirement in Roopena Agrahara. The BDA filed a writ appeal on this. A single bench held that the layout project had lapsed as the compensation award was passed in April 2010 though the preliminary and final notifications were issued in 1984 and 1986 respectively."

The current state of affairs might make it difficult for the society to perform its duties in the near future, say officials. USACS has still not received about Rs 2.5 crore from the state health department. Meanwhile, a government order marking March 31 as the deadline for release of funds for 2014-15 was passed on Friday. According to USACS officials, the Centre\u2019s new process of routing funds through the state health department which was implemented in 2014 is the main contributing factor behind the delay. \u201cEarlier, the funds used to come directly to the society. Now, sending it through the state makes it a cumbersome process. We\u2019ve to inform the state of our requirements and depend on them for release of funds. If they delay the release, utilization of the money takes more time and the Centre in turn stops payment of the next installment,\u201d said a USACS top brass. The process of funds transfer involves the director general of health and family welfare, the state government and the finance department at various levels. Official procedures often result in delays of up to three months in receiving funds. Also, a 30% cutback on national AIDS control organisation\u2019s (NACO) budgets in 2014-15 has prompted the organization to circulate a notice to state societies asking them to stop information, education and communication (IEC) activities. USACS runs over 12 programs including integrated counseling and testing centres, anti-retroviral therapy outlets and monitoring initiatives. Hurdles in the functioning of any of these adversely affect over 5,000 HIV+ individuals in the state."

At daybreak, people begin to crowd around in the bustling marketplace to buy idlis and dosas from a woman who is HIV positive. Vijayarani's customers are aware of her condition, but have no problem patronising her. Vijayarani and her co-worker Sumathy, 40, who is also HIV positive, run the shop together, earning up to Rs 500 per day. On the eve of World AIDS day, the duo serve as yet another reminder of the manner in which the stigma attached to the disease can be overcome even in a socially backward town like Usilampatti. It was only three years ago that Vijayarani's world fell apart. She and her six-year-old son were diagnosed as HIV-positive. But when her husband, Elango, tested negative, he began taunting his wife and finally told her that he was leaving her for good. Vijayarani had contracted the disease from her first husband, who had died a few years earlier. \"Initially, I was devastated. I didn't know what to do. Then, I heard about the Vaigai network of people living with HIV/AIDS,\" she said. These women do not hide the fact that they are carriers of the deadly virus, but say that the society around them has come to accept them. \"People have come to realise that mere physical contact with a HIV-positive person does not spread the disease,\" she pointed out. Frail and thin, Vijayarani started out on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) soon after the diagnosis, and alongside struggled to achieve financial independence. \"I look as healthy as any woman in our village and we have a successful business. Isn't that proof enough?\" she said in between ladling sambar for her customers. Vijayarani admitted her son in school after informing the authorities of his condition. Now the nine-year-old is a student in the fifth standard who comes within the top ten ranks in the class. T Rajapandian, a local, who frequents the shop, vouches for Vijayarani. \"There is nothing to beat her two-rupee idlis and dosas and the tasty accompaniments. I also take parcels home for my children at nights,\" he said. P Annathai, who had been instrumental in spreading awareness about the shop, said, \"I told my family and friends that we should help them and not shun them.\" Dr E S Thangapandian, programme manager of the government-run district AIDS Prevention and Control Unit said, \"Theirs is an example for many to follow\"."

After a delay of nearly a year, the Cabinet committee, on Friday, gave its nod for implementing phase IV of the National AIDS Programme with a financial sanction of 2550 crore. This is a mere 35% of the funding it gave in the last three phases of the National Aids Control Project. Health officials have been instructed to expect sizeable cutbacks in their programmes. \u201cOur staff across the state will be cut down by half,\u201d said an official. \u201cWe also expect some reduction in salaries,\u201d he said. Moreover, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has mandated that NGOs may now only conduct awareness programmes, rather than assist the government in providing support and care. \u201cNutritional support has reduced and the Centre has suggested we rely on existing state welfare schemes to help patients,\u201d said the official. So far, funding for this project came from USAID, Bill Gates Foundation and the World Bank. When the Phase III ended last year, the Centre had to dip into its coffers for Phase IV in May 2011. During this transition phase, no funds were forthcoming and many centres struggled for months. It is only now that the Centre has approved the sum, but with a huge cutback. Social workers worry that unless enough funds are pumped in, it will be hard to maintain status quo. \u201cNow that NGOs have been asked to do only awareness programmes, the follow-up procedure for Anti-Retroviral Therapy patients will be inadequate,\u201d said P Kousalya of South India Positive People\u2019s Network. \u201cA lot of HIV-related work involves home visitswhere they persuade the patient to come in for treatment. Since the government does not have such widespread infrastructure, NGOs do it in many places. Now this will be curtailed.\u201d"

The policy will aim to achieve zero new HIV infections among workers. Garasiya was addressing a gathering of officials of Central government, state's labour department, International Labour Organization, Ministry of labour and employment and Rajasthan State Aids Control Society at a workshop on 'National Policy on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work' in the city. Garasiya said it should be the government's priority to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS among people in the age group of 15-49 years. \"The spread of HIV/AIDS among labourers has adverse impact on productivity; therefore, it is essential to check it.\" Experts claimed that nearly 90% of the reported HIV infections are diagnosed in the most productive age group. The stigma and social discrimination towards HIV/AIDS patients also needs to be discouraged. Additional secretary, Union labour ministry Ravi Mathur said a National policy on HIV/AIDS and world of work has been recently formulated. He also stressed on the need for zero discrimination towards HIV patients at the workplace. Principal secretary, labour Lalit Mehra said, \"It is necessary to discuss with employers and labour unions before formulating workplace policy in the state.\" The participants also talked about discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS at workplace. They advocated that such discrimination should not be happen in workplace as people living with HIV/AIDS have right to earn in a dignified way. The Union labour ministry also provided a checklist for planning and implementing a workplace policy and programme on HIV/AIDS. The objective of the workshop was to provide complete information of the national policy on HIV/AIDS in the world of work to help the stakeholders in developing plans to fight against HIV/AIDS in the world of work."

National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) data shows Gujarat has the largest number of HIV positive cases due to blood transfusion. In the state, which is above national average in terms of prevalence and seventh in the country in general prevalence, nearly one in every five cases reported is recorded as caused due to blood transfusion. Tamil Nadu, which stands 11th in general prevalence, has reported 1,134 cases due to blood transfusion, coming sixth in the category. The data is based on information provided by patients at Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) run by the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco). Experts said that there could be misreporting as patients tend to give blood transfusion as the reason to hide unsafe sex. Doctors said a person could contract HIV through blood transfusion if the blood bank is not equipped with fourth generation (ELISA) testing kits. \u201cThird generation kits used in government health centres have the ability to detect the infection after 8-12 weeks. Fourth generation kits can detect it as early as from the fourth week,\u201d said Dr A Sathish Kumar from Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India (SAATHI), an organisation working with HIV patients across the country. There have been instances where individuals have donated blood without knowing that they are HIV positive. The fourth generation kit detects infections in the window period and blood donated by them can be rejected straight away, said a former AIDS Control Society Official. \u201cNaco has been allocated close to Rs1,600 crore. Authorities should procure the latest testing kits to reduce chances of HIV transmission through transfusion,\u201d he said. Kerala has recently (January 2018) announced that these state-of-the-art devices would soon be installed in its hospitals. This decision was taken after a nine-year-old patient at Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram tested positive for HIV after blood transfusion . On the other hand, most private medical labs in the country are equipped with these latest kits and charge Rs 300 - Rs 1,000 for HIV screening."

The CB-NAAT equipment was introduced at the KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC) in Trichy from Tuesday. The state-of-the-art diagnosing equipment, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) became functional at the KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC) in Trichy from Tuesday to diagnose TB in HIV positive patients. It would ensure speedy results thus enabling officials to assess the health condition of the patients and begin the treatment as soon as possible. Dean M K Muralitharan of KAPVGMC inaugurated the equipment at the microbiology department of the college in a low-key affair. The microbiology department had so far relied on conventional and fluorescent microscopy to carry out sputum test to diagnose TB. However, the sensitivity of the tests through microscopy was between 60% and 70% for normal patients found with cold, cough and fever. As far as HIV patients were concerned, the sensitivity was very low. \u201cWith the setting up of CB-NAAT here, the detection of TB in HIV patients will be easier than before because the new equipment, will drastically reduce the processing time. So, the treatment can begin earlier,\u201d said Dr S Dhanapaul, head, department of biotechnology, KAPVGMC. Almost all HIV patients will be prone to TB. So, the staff at antivirus retroviral therapy (ART) centres in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy and link ARTs across the district and neighbouring districts in the region will send the sputum to the microbiology department. A training programme for lab technicians in Trichy, Madurai and Tirunelveli was also arranged to provide hands-on experience by Dr Raja from Chennai and Dr Delphin from Coimbatore, who were deputed by the WHO. A total of 1,522 pulmonary TB patients including 1,150 men and 372 women were identified in Trichy in 2014. The district had 45 field staff to provide treatment to TB patients."

        "body": "JAIPUR: This year Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) will give preference in allotting the dairy booths to the women suffering from HIV+, cancer or a widow. They will be allotted one booth in every ward in the Jaipur city. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had declared that 5,000 dairy booths will be opened in the state for the women out of which 1,000 will be in Jaipur city. This will be done to empower women and to raise employment opportunities for them. Along with this, there are even plans to open a single window for licensing in the JMC office as the complaints of the public towards the authorities related to the issue of licensing for dairy booths are rising in number. This plan is made to keep a check on the officials so that problem will not be created for the general public. Jaipur city is divided into eight zones and at present in every zone a junior engineer (JEN) look after the matter but after the implementation of single window, soon two JEN and two clerks will look after the matters of four zones each in the office to be allotted in the JMC. Mayor Ashok Lahoti said, \u201cThe decision to open a single window is taken to make the licensing scheme more transparent. There is a plan to open 1,000 new dairy booths in the city and new licenses will be given only to the ladies as per the social welfare scheme announced by the chief minister Vasundhara Raje. In all the 91 wards, we have planned to give one dairy booth to the women suffering from AIDS, cancer or is a widow, to help them earn a decent living.\u201d To increase the competition in the state regarding the milk sale JMC has even planned to give 100 booths to the Amul dairy which will also be the company\u2019s first entry in Rajasthan. The chairman of the licensing committee Mahesh Kalwani told TOI that the proposal for single window for licensing is made to give proper shape to the plans of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. \u201cI have met many people who have complained about the red tap-ism and corruption that is rampant during the time of license issuing. Even all the applications do not reach us as the officials send applications of those that fulfils their interests and pockets. When the work will start here then we can check for any discrepancies while issuing the order\u201d said that Kalwani."

        "title": "Over 200 AIDS patients drop out of treatment, traceless",
        "body": "KOLHAPUR: Health officials in the district are concerned about the 207 AIDS patients who have dropped out of the treatment after taking the initial doses of medication during the last six years. To make matter worse, the District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU) has not been able to trace them even. The patients, who have abandoned treatment, are labelled as 'lost to follow-up' (LFU) cases and have a higher mortality risk as compared with those who continue regular anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Once counted among the six high prevalence districts in the state, the ratio of HIV positive patients to that of total tested has declined from 10.07% in 2007 to 2.7% in 2013 in Kolhapur. There are four anti-retroviral treatment centres (ARTs) in the district. DAPCU officials said that of the 207 LFU cases, about 153 were registered at the district civil hospital, 48 at Gadhingalaj ART centre, four at the Ichalkaranji centre and two at the Savitribai Phule KMC hospital. About 127 LFU patients are females. Programme officer of DAPCU Deepa Shipurkar said, \"Around 207 patients are untraceable since 2007, when the first ART centre was started in Kolhapur. The reasons for LFU cases are poor family support, social stigma, logistic problems and economic reasons, which include the cost of travelling to the ART centres.\" She added, \"We are currently collecting all available information regarding these patients and will soon launch a full fledged drive to reach out to these patients.\" Counsellors will visit the homes of these patients and try to convince them and their family members to resume the medications. However, it is difficult to bring them back to the treatment due to the social stigma, health officials said. In August, DAPCU launched the project called 'Vihaan' which ensures that the people living with HIV undergo regular follow-ups on health parameters. The aim of the project is to make patients aware about nutrition, healthy lifestyles and the available social and economic support. In addition, one-on-one counseling and support group meetings will be organized. The project also aims to train service providers and give them periodic feedback on service quality."

        "body": "MADURAI: Even though the government is taking steps to get rid off stigma about AIDS in the society, it appears that more needs to be done to eliminate it. Even parents' death due to AIDS is an obstacle for marriage as was experienced by a young woman in Sivaganga district. After her bridegroom backed off from marrying her a week before the wedding, the woman has now filed a complaint with the police. In defence, the bridegroom has approached the court seeking immunity from police intervention. Marriage between P Sevugan, 38, of Sudanipatti and K Anbuselvi of Vanjinipatti in Sivagangai district has been scheduled for June 19 at Muraiyur Sri Meenakshi Amman Sokkanathar temple. The invite cards were also printed and other arrangements were on, when Sevugan decided to call off the alliance after hearing that Anbuselvi's parents had died of AIDS. Even though, Anbuselvi showed him medical report that gave her clean chit with regard to HIV, Sevugan remained adamant. Following it, she filed a complaint before the Thiruppathur all-women police station on June 5 seeking action against the groom. She stated that after the death of her parents, she is living with her grandmother and her younger brother. Despite being a labourer, she managed to purchase jewels and home appliances worth Rs 4 lakh for the marriage. Inspector M Jayanthi said that her planned wedding was rescinded by the groom due to HIV stigma. Police even sent Anbuselvi to a private hospital to undergo HIV test which confirmed that she is not affected with HIV, she said. After her petition, Sevugan has now approached the high court bench, seeking interim injunction restraining the all-women police from insisting him to marry the girl. In his petition he contended that after he knew that her parents' death was due to AIDS, he had confirmed the matter with Anbuselvi's relatives. Thereafter, he refused to marry her and his decision was accepted by her relatives, he said. When the writ petition came up before Justice N Kirubakaran, notice was ordered to be issued to the superintendent of police, Sivagangai, all-women police station and Anbuselvi. The matter was posted for hearing on Friday."

A team of researchers at the the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US created the drug, known by the acronym DRACO, which homes in on infected cells and makes them self-destructive . Its hit list includes human rhinoviruses - the bugs that causes colds in adults and in children - flu, polio, a stomach bug and deadly dengue fever. But DRACO is also expected to zap measles and German measles, cold sores, rabies and even HIV - and could be on pharmacy shelves in a decade, the Daily Mail reported. Lead researcher Mike Rider said, \"It's certainly possible that there's some virus that we aren't able to treat but we haven't found it yet.\" In lab tests, DRACO killed 15 viruses. It also saved the lives of mice given a dose of flu that would have killed them."

Through this regional strategy, WHO urged member countries to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care and to contribute to health- related millennium development goals (MDGs), particularly MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). To ensure this, primary healthcare needs to be revitalised, and health services integrated to strengthen links between HIV, TB, sexual, reproductive health and maternal and child health. The goals are guided by principles that include tackling the social determinants of health that drive the epidemic and also hinder the response; protecting human rights and promoting gender equality; and integrating HIV and other health services. A WHO official said countries must prioritise advocacy for reducing drug prices, train and sensitise health workers and minimise HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings. HIV testing and counselling needs to be decentralised to enable people to know their HIV status. The goals of the regional strategy are to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care. The second goal is to contribute to the achievement of millennium development goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) and other health-related goals (MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 8) and associated targets. WHO has four strategic directions to achieve the goals, one is to optimise HIV prevention, care and treatment. This includes preventing sexual transmission of HIV, eliminating congenital syphilis, access to safe blood transfusion, comprehensive and integrated services for sex workers, homosexuals, people who use drugs, young, displaced, mobile and migrant populations. The second direction is to strengthen strategic information systems for HIV research, as information on the various aspects of the issue is crucial in guiding policy and decision-making. The third is to strengthening health systems so that HIV services are part of other essential services that are available, accessible and affordable. The fourth direction is creating a supportive environment to ensure that everyone has equitable access to HIV services."

Technology today is enabling residents keep an eye on their house and grounds from the comfort of their phones. It is also enabling them to talk to visitors, when they are not at home. With IOT and tech-enabled security solutions, residents are relying less on professional security guards and more on video-door-phones, other technology that lets users monitor activity from their smartphone. Such technology helps remote monitoring of activities with footage being stored on the cloud. While branded video door phones are used by those who can afford, tech-savvy customers are designing their own solutions using apps such as the Salient Eye and AtHome Camera. With an old smartphone or tablet doubling up as a camera, individuals have burglar alarms set up using SMS alerts or picture feeds which can be accessed remotely. Brands such as Panasonic, Godrej and Videocon have been seeing an uptick for these devices in the last 6-9 months. \u201cResidential segment is one of the biggest adopter of video door phones, especially the affluent high-rise apartments, gated communities, and integrated townships. Region wise, North and South are biggest contributors with 39% and 33%,\u201dsaid Manish Sharma, president and CEO, Panasonic India and South-Asia. Companies add that the solutions also end up being cost-effective. For instance, professionally manned security firms charge over Rs 5,000 per month for an eight-hour shift and the cost of hiring goes up to Rs 1.5 lakh a year, but a VDP comes at a significantly lesser price with multiple features. The price ranges from Rs 5,000 to Rs 40,000 a unit. Arvind Bali, CEO, Videocon Telecom adds that the market, which was predominated by Chinese brands, is now seeking attention of home grown brands. \u201cThe servers of these devices are housed in China. However, our servers are in Mohali. Overall, the market is slated to grow at 50%, with increasing demand from residents,\u201d he added. Firms are also tying up with IoT providers to make such security options a part of home automation. With the option to have multiple smartphones access data from an outdoor surveillance unit, apartments can also share the cost. Godrej Security Solutions has devices that directly live-stream the feed to home owners. \u201cIt is of immense use to working professionals, who want to keep an eye on elders, who live alone. We have the products in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 9,000 to keep it affordable for the average smartphone user,\u201d said Mehernosh Pithawalla, VP and global head \u2013 marketing, sales & innovation, GSS."

District deputy collector Sanjay Pawar flagged off the van which will be visiting various colleges and villages in the district. For the first time, the Sangli will also be covered under the awareness campaign and events and meetings will be held with college youngsters and in villages.

Deepa Shipurkar, DAPCU district programme officer, said, \"We have been regularly screening the sugarcane harvesters and we also found some infected persons during the regular check-ups.

The incident immediately brought to the activist\u2019s notice the absence of effective tools to help a person in danger in ways that were quick, efficient and self-reliant. Thus was born the idea for an app that could systematically deliver various kinds of assistance to a survivor of gender-based violence. The app \u2018Saahas\u2019 was launched in June this year. Cashing in on the versatility of smart phone applications, app makers have for a while now, exploited the freedom to transmit GPS-identified locations to offer wide-ranging SOS and emergency contact services for women. But now, the time is to fine-tune these services, believe activists. \"I wanted to create an app that could tell where to get help when in danger, and also enable bystander intervention,\" says Jayakumar. \"We work on educating bystanders, so that they can identify signs in an individual to know when they are facing violence. For a survivor to speak up is an act of courage. But for a bystander, to intervene is both an act of courage and knowledge,\" she adds. Saahas has had 719 downloads so far, of which 62% have been in India. It has nine verticals, including police and ambulance helplines, consulates and embassies helplines, medical and legal help, and child and refugee-specific support. While new ways of addressing old challenges is the key, equally essential is to operate existing mechanisms with better efficiency, believes city-based women\u2019s rights NGO Aware, which has partnered with popular safety audit and tracking app, Safetipin, in a new campaign. Aware\u2019s collaboration with Safetipin is part of its campaign \u2018Safe Cities\u2019, which in turn is a spillover of its \u2018nomorenirbhaya\u2019 campaign. While Safetipin was launched in 2013, Aware found that the app\u2019s reach in Chennai was still limited to a few users. \"We had already planned to conduct safety audits in the city, but realised that the app would make it easier to record the data and generate a comprehensive report,\" says Sandhiyan Thilagavathy, founder, Aware. Safetipin allows the user to measure and record the safety standard of a location, by conducting a safety audit of the area, based on nine parameters that the app enlists \u2014 from lighting in the area and visibility, to walk paths, security and gender diversity. It also has a personal safety tracker feature. \"Based on the reports generated from our audits, we will be able to follow up with the respective authorities to introduce changes; for instance, if an area doesn\u2019t have sufficient lighting, we will submit a petition to the municipal corporation, or in case of inadequate security, we will touch base with the concerned police station and ask officials to conduct regular patrolling during late hours. In order to get a clear picture of the situation, we conduct the audits only post 6pm,\" says Thilagavathy. She acknowledges that mobilising the public to consistently use the app and conduct safety audits in their neighbourhoods, schools and colleges isn\u2019t easy. \"We are working towards building the strength of our volunteers, who will reach out to their respective communities to educate people on the app,\" says Thilagavathy. Aware plans to connect with residential associations and the Shrimathi Devkunvar Nanalal Bhatt Vaishnav College for Women in Chromepet to educate residents and students about the app and mobilise volunteers."

Besides, addicts would be motivated to shed use of syringes as the same could trigger HIV infection. Health employees are already being trained in this connection. A couple of days back, an inspection was conducted at Civil Hospital by NACO officials in the city. In the inspection, along with the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre, blood bank was checked. It was decided to start the oral substitution therapy for intravenous drug users (IDU). Under this programme, oral medicines would be given to all drug users to help them kick the habit. This would also help in reducing the risk of HIV transmission from one intravenous drug user to another. Needles are a predominant mode of spread of HIV. And addicts often stop caring about sharing of needles, resulting in a higher risk of contracting HIV. A few weeks back, a study was conducted by an NGO Rising Youth, wherein it was revealed 75% truck drivers visit commercial sex workers and syringes are commonly used by them. What is more alarming is that only 10% of these drivers use precautions like contraceptives. Another study, one done by Ludhiana Citizen Council, revealed that during pre-AIDS prevention intervention, it was found only 17% of the respondents had heard of HIV/AIDS and were not aware of modes of its transmission and symptoms. Dr Geetika, district AIDS control programme officer, said this is the latest advancement, which National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is undertaking with respect to intravenous drug use so as to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Under the oral substitution method, medicines would be given so as to control and avoid chances of HIV spread among addicts. She added: \"It is expected that the programme will take off soon as staff has already been sent for related training to Chandigarh.\""

The woman got married to her paternal cousin in June 2015 in the Nashik Road area. In March 2017, when she got pregnant, a private doctor informed her that she was HIV+. Subsequently, the pregnancy was terminated. After her in-laws realised that she was HIV+, they allegedly stopped her from cooking in the house, started starving her and harassed her mentally and physically while alleging that she transmitted the disease to her husband. Given the torture from her in-laws, she contacted her brother, who took her home in May 2017. While none of her in-laws came to take her back, her husband died of AIDS in January 2018. The woman was also verbally abused by her in-laws when she went to attend her husband's funeral. Feeling cheated and humiliated of being falsely accused of transmitting the disease to her husband, the woman lodged a complaint with the Kopargaon police on March 5, which was transferred to the Mumbai Naka police in Nashik city on Wednesday. Speaking to TOI, one of her relatives said that despite being closely related to the in-laws, the woman was cheated. \"Her husband was suffering from HIV for the past many years. After she was diagnosed with HIV, her husband even confided in her that it was because of him that she got the disease. He said he was not expecting the disease to be transmitted to her since he was on medication,\" said their relative. The Mumbai naka police have registered a case against four members of the woman's in-laws under sections 498 (A) (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 420 (cheating), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (Intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.

Closed-group communities, NGOs and activists working for gay rights termed the apex court order \"a regressive move which would not only set the country back in terms of social inclusivity, but would increase health issues among the minority group\". Bindumadhav Khire, president of Samapathik Trust, an organization that works for men's sexual health, said, \"Now, the number of cases of unsafe sex is bound to increase, as members of the LGBT community would be scared of coming out in the open. This also means an increase in the number of HIV-AIDS cases.\" Tinesh Chopade, manager of the HIV-prevention project within the Trust, said the community members would fear discussing their health issues openly. \"After the Delhi high court order of 2009, we had seen an increase in the number of LGBT people approaching us with their medical problems. At our level, we have conducted free-of-charge tests for sexually-transmitted infections. We even distributed condoms besides counselling them about safe sex. All that is bound to change, and change for the worse,\" Chopade said. The data related to sexual health of the community members speaks for itself. Vivek Tigote, project director in Samapathik Trust, said, \"Since 2009, the rate of HIV within the LGBT community declined from 8% to 4.3%. More and more people were willing to come out in the open and discuss their medical issues with doctors. Now, it will send the members of the community into hiding again.\" S T Pardeshi, medical officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation, said the LGBT community is more susceptible to sexually-transmitted diseases. \"The civic body is keen to counsel and guide them. We regularly conduct information sessions in colleges and in red-light areas about safe sex practices. The PMC is willing to help them, but a majority of them hide behind a veil of secrecy,\" Pardeshi said. Globally, it has been proven that criminalization of any kind of sexual act leads to an increase in the risk of HIV among its practitioners, said Sanjay Pujari, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases. Pujari said the SC order is going to be detrimental for the medical health of the community. \"Since the Delhi HC order of 2009, I have met many HIV patients who are very open and upfront about their sexual orientation. They are a minority group, and because of the nature of their sexual activity, the LGBT community is at a higher risk of acquiring HIV. It's thus imperative that HIV prevention programmes reach them, which I feel will become difficult now as they would be unwilling to speak openly,\" he said."

        "body": "MUMBAI: The dreaded combo of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and tuberculosis, one of the leading killers in patients, finally seems to be coming under control in Mumbai. The city has recorded a remarkable dip in the number of cross-infections and the success has been attributed to early detection and awareness. HIV, per se, does not kill but rather makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections by lowering immunity. Tuberculosis takes the top spot as the biggest opportunistic infection and killer among HIV patients. Statistics compiled by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has revealed how in the last six years the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV suspects has halved. If 15% of patients who walked in for HIV testing in 2007 were found to be suffering from TB, it came down to 7% till last year. The same trend has been witnessed in those suffering from tuberculosis. TB patients remain highly vulnerable to HIV as global numbers suggest that around 13-14% end up contracting the bacterial infection. Here too, the MDACS records show that significant improvement has been made. From an incidence of 10% TB patients contracting HIV, the percentage has come down to 3% and remained there in the last two years. Additional project director of MDACS Dr Balkrishna Adsul said increased awareness among both set of patients could be one of the main reasons. According to Dr Minni Khetarpal, BMC\u2019s special tuberculosis officer, a smooth synchronization of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has contributed to almost 100% of the patients suffering from the co-infection getting the right drugs. \u201cWe have made it mandatory for the TB officers to send the patients for HIV testing within a month of enrolling in RNTCP,\u201d she said."

        "body": "MANGALURU: The state government is contemplating to introduce a single window system and special 'Jan Samparka Sabha' exclusively for HIV positive persons from January 2015. Health and family welfare minister U T Khader said that a single window system involving various departments will be introduced in all the districts of the state exclusively for those diagnosed HIV positive. This is to help them get various government benefits including treatment, housing, self-employment schemes, ration cards etc. under one umbrella. Participating in an interaction programme with HIV positive parents and children organized by the District Aids Control Organisation and Prajna Counselling Centre here on Saturday, Khader said that the move is aimed at helping such people avail the benefits of government schemes. \"The single window system is mooted as there are several complaints from HIV positive people being subjected to discrimination and social stigma in the society and government offices. To solve such issues, the proposed system, involving officials from health, food and civil supplies, housing, social welfare and other departments will be introduced in Karnataka,\" he said. During the programme, an HIV positive woman said she was subjected to discrimination when she visited various government offices for a house. \"My application for a house has been rejected. Officials have treated me in a discriminating way since I am HIV Positive,\" she said. Another HIV positive woman said nurses in a government hospital refused to treat her while she was pregnant. Khader, taking note of the same, said such instances of social stigma and discrimination of HIV positive people should be brought to the notice of the authorities concerned immediately. Instead of visiting various department offices, HIV positive beneficiaries may submit applications for various government scheme benefits at one particular point. The same applications will be forwarded to the departments concerned through the new system,\" the minister added. Jan Samparka Sabha to address grievances The department will also commence special Jan Samparka Sabha, grievance meet for HIV positive persons from January 2015. Deputy commissioners, chief executive officers of zilla panchayats, tahsildars and officials of various departments will listen to the grievances of such people and make efforts to sort out issues on the spot,\" he added. District Aids control officer, Dr Kishore Kumar, Prajna Counselling Centre director, Hilda Rayappan, and district child protection officer Usman were present."

Six out of every 10,000 people in China may be infected with HIV/AIDS, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said providing statistics from January to October this year. Describing the situation as a 'mild pandemic', men who have sex with men have become the group with the highest infection rate, the CDC said. Around 8 per cent of men who have sex with men in China are living with HIV/AIDS, according to 2015 statistics. Sexual transmission is the main infection channel, with infection through heterosexual activities accounting for 66.6 per cent of total cases, those through homosexual activities 27.2 per cent, while mother-to-child and drug needle infection rates are low. Infections among young people have become particularly noticeable, as 2,662 new cases of students living with HIV/AIDS were reported from January to October, a surge of 27.8 per cent year on year, the CDC said. Some 97,000 new cases in total were reported in the period. World AIDS day is celebrated on December 1 to unite people to fight against HIV virus, first identified in 1984."

A technical team from the JSACS took samples from the people of 5,480 families of the Bishnugarh block of Hazaribag between April 2008 and May 2011, and found as many as 266 people were infected with the virus. Patnaik said under the annual surveillance conducted by the Union health ministry, Bishungarh block of Hazaribag was identified as a high risk group site and widespread survey was conducted by the society. Given the startling figures, the JSACS has opened a special cell on the block hospital premises to test blood samples and also to create awareness among people against HIV and its prevention. A large number of residents of this block, mostly drivers and labourers, migrate to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and its surrounding areas in search of employment. Normally, the labourers keep their families in their native places and develop unprotected sexual relationship with women suffering from HIV. When they come home during festivals and cultivation time, infect their wives vis-a-vis families with the virus. Residents said the number of deaths were higher than the official figures as the JSACS team has not visited many remote and Maoistprone areas like Kargalo, Purnata, Telanidah Saapmar More in Narki Panchayat. \"Out of over 5,000 samples collected from the Bishnugarh block, as many as 266 were found positive, responding to which a cell has been established in which counsellors and technical staff have been deputed,\" she added. However, the appointment of a woman counsellor remains on paper only. Though a counselling centre was opened here in 2008, till now not a single counsellor has remained on the post for the past three years. Since the counsellors are sent from Ranchi, the post continues to be vacant. \"There is a need to appoint a local counsellor who can spread awareness in villages,\" said Dr A P Singh at the Hazaribagh Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre."

        "body": "BENGALURU: The gender diversity among IT ITES banking sector employees using office transport to commute to and from their workplace in Bengaluru (41%) is better than that of Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and the National Capital Region but just a shade behind Chennai. The recent survey also found that more than half the women (59%) who use office transport in Bengaluru do so between 8pm and 8am. However, Bengaluru stood third, after Chennai and Mumbai, in this regard among the six cities surveyed. The analysis of 9 lakh rides by MoveInSync, which enables companies manage employee transportation, was done in the backdrop of rampant harassment of women in trains and railway platforms, efforts to improve gender diversity at workplaces and more women opting to join companies in night shifts, especially those providing transportation. The rides were analyzed during July 2017. In Bengaluru, 3.64 lakh rides were analyzed, while in Chennai and Hyderabad, 1.13 lakh and 1.72 lakh rides were studied. Only 91,000 and 80,000 rides were analysed in Pune and Mumbai. \u201cNone of these six cities have a solid public transport system at night. Safety is not just the concern of woman employees but the employer too which is why we see wom en working after 8pm in IT ITES banking sectors being provided cabs to go home,\u201c Deepesh Agarwal, founder, MoveInSync, said. The research found that women feel more comfortable with tech-driven safety measures. \u201cCompanies do provide private security personnel to escort employees to pick up or drop at odd hours but if employees have an app on their phones through which they can alert their office about the ride or have panic button systems in cabs or apps, they feel more secure,\u201c Agarwal told TOI. Wipro said it not only provides transport for employees during odd hours in accordance with the law but also ensures they reach home safe by adding multi ple layers of security. About 35%-36% of its women employees work between 8pm and 8am in ITITES and support functions. \u201cWe have installed GPS with panic buttons and hooters in all our vehicles. The moment a woman traveller presses the panic button, the shrill hooter goes on for three minutes so that other vehicles around are alerted. We also have algorithms to ensure the woman employee is not the second drop and the second pick up in case the first employee is a no-show. We also give automated calls to an employee if she is dropped at her destination even five minutes later than the estimate,\u201c Nittan Bhalla, GM and head of facilities, Wipro, said. The research analyzed shiftwise details. \u201cWhile women seem to make their own arrangements for reaching office in the morning, they use company provided transport to reach home at night,\u201c it revealed. It found that compared to men, women seem to stay closer to office \u00ad they travel a lesser distance and hence take lesser time to reach office. Sarmila Karmakar, an ITES employee in Manyata Tech Park, admitted she felt safe because of the transportation provided by her firm.\u201cApart from a security guard, we have an app through which the office management tracks our ride and we can alert them if the driver takes a longer route, drops me last or misbehaves, among other things,\u201c she said. TIMES VIEW Women using office transport for the commute to work feel secure when their organisations go the extra mile to ensure their safety. It's heartening to know that some organisations have multiple layers of security in place and this can make all the difference. It's now up to all companies to pick up the best practices available and pre-empt any incidents of harassment. Sensitising cab drivers, doing thorough background checks, constantly updating their system and cracking down when required are an absolute must for managers of office transportation."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Scientists claim to have found evidence that HIV-1 in semen is different from HIV-1 in blood, possibly due to changes the virus undergoes in the male genital tract. To better understand the process by which HIV is transmitted, experts compared the gene encoding the major surface protein of HIV in semen and blood. \"In some men, the virus population in semen was similar to that in the blood, suggesting that virus was being imported from the blood into the genital tract and not being generated locally in the genital tract. \"We found two mechanisms that significantly altered the virus population in the semen, showing that virus can grow in the seminal tract in two different ways,\" Ronald Swanstrom of North Carolina University, who led the team, said. In one way, one or more viruses grow rapidly in the seminal tract over a short period such that the viral population in semen is homogeneous as compared to the population in the blood. In the other way, the virus replicates in T cells in the seminal tract over a long period, creating a separate population of virus in semen that is distinct from the blood virus."

Today, Munna (name changed) is on the verge of death. This innocent boy contracted the deadly Aids disease from his parents. He doesn't know what it means and doesn't respond to any of your queries. Last week, he suddenly collapsed while having dinner. He was rushed to the medico but the doctors said he was alright. Next day, he suffered a paralytic attack and on subsequent day, lost his vision. Munna had already lost his father, a daily wager, to this deadly disease five years back. His poor mother Parvati, who is also HIV positive, tried hard to treat him from reputed doctors in the city. In the process, she exhausted her savings of Rs 30,000 she had accumulated over the years. Fortunately, her other two children haven't contracted this disease. Her life was shattered after her husband died, but she was given a helping hand by ACCEPT, an NGO that works for welfare of people living with HIV (PLHIV). She now works in the same organisation at a meager salary of about Rs 3,000 in which she manages her household expenditure and education of her three children. She also pays Rs 600 rent in her extremely small 10X5 sq ft room and travels by cycle. Despite all these problems, she is putting up a brave front and hasn't lost hope. \"I visited many doctors, but his disease could not be detected. He is HIV positive since birth. We know that he will not last beyond 15-20 years. But at this tender age, he became paralytic and lost his vision, which is rare,\" she says. Sameer Shinde, working with ACCEPT centre, is helping the family to save Munna. \"He's very enthusiastic and brilliant kid and used to interact with us whenever he used to come with his mother. He is very friendly and intelligent,\" he said. \"Even we were shocked over his rapidly deteriorating health,\" ACCEPT coordinator Josh Varghese Joy says, adding that they had sent the kid to their Bangalore head office where such types of cases are usually handled. ACCEPT workers are helping out Munna and they are glad that people are coming forward to help too. When Munna and his mother were travelling to Bangalore, they had tickets for the sleeper class but had to be upgraded to the AC car as the sleeper class was full. \"Even AC was full, but we requested the ticket checker to allot them at least one berth. Surprisingly, he didn't charge us even a single penny extra for the ticket seeing Munna's worsening condition and prayed for his life,\" Joy said."

        "body": "NAGPUR: A social worker has moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, praying for additional testing machine, called as CD-4, for AIDS survivors at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). The machine calculates the white blood cells of AIDS infected persons, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicine has to be administered immediately if the count goes below 350. A division bench comprising justice Arun Chaudhari and justice PN Deshmukh issued notices to the respondents, asking them to reply before June second week, before adjourning the hearing after the vacations. The respondents include union ministry of health and family welfare, department of AIDS Control under National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), state department of health and family welfare, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society and GMCH dean. Petitioner Mohan Karemore contends that there is only one CD-4 machine at GMCH and it\u2019s out of order since three months. His counsel Vivek Awchat pointed out that even when working, this machine is overloaded since samples from other ART centres at Saoner, Ramtek, Bhiwapur, Katol, Hingna and Gondia are also tested on it. The machine at GMC accepts samples from 9:30am till 2:30pm and then those are tested. The test reports are not given to patients for three to four days. It can test only 200 samples and if it breaks down, then there is no other alternative. The samples are required to be disposed off and the AIDS survivor has to revisit the centre. This test has to be performed every three months for doctors to find the unique combination of medicines for each patient, Awchat said. (With inputs from Shyla Bhagwagar)"

        "title": "Should an HIV test before marriage be made compulsory?",
        "body": "Even as the state government actively considers the move, we delve into the issue Madhu\u2019s (name changed) life has just come crashing down. The 23-year-old, married for the past one-and-a-half years, has tested positive for HIV and she knows she has contracted it from her husband. Her family is distraught but there\u2019s little they can do. \u201cNow, we realise the importance of getting an HIV test done before marriage,\u201d says her father. Madhu\u2019s is not the only case. Many such instances across the country are highlighting an urgent need to make HIV test mandatory before marriage. The State Women and Child Development department is actively considering the move. In fact, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister, Women and Child Development, recently said that her department had sought opinions in this regard from UNICEF and NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients. But to bring about this rule, amendments to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts, will be needed. And even though it looks like the need of the hour, it\u2019s not that simple. In the past, such a move has encountered a number of hindrances. Why some people are opposing the move: Some argue that making this test mandatory infringes upon a person\u2019s right to privacy, which is a fundamental human right. Also, a big concern is that post-tests, an infected person may be ostracised in his/her community. A generalised policy like this could adversely affect HIV control programme itself, as fear of social discrimination could force people to flee rather than come forward to declare their HIV status. That apart, there are people opposing it because of the veracity of HIV tests. A wrong diagnosis could cause havoc in a person's life. Besides, there is something called a window period during which a person may test negative despite being infected. Says gynaecologist Dr Firuza Parekh, \"The HIV test is not fool-proof. At the time of testing, a person may come negative but turn positive six months later due to the window period. That apart, there's also the question of who will bear the cost of the test. So, what are we trying to prove through these tests? Is it just promiscuity because in that case, a person could even cheat by getting somebody else's test result.\" Sexologist and marriage counsellor Dr Shirish Malde, agrees. \"People might resort to getting fake test reports. Also, asking for this test can give rise to certain trust issues,\" he says. But the fact is that there are many cases where a person has contracted the virus from his/her partner and often it comes to fore when the woman is pregnant, he says. \"And the person who was already infected at the time of marriage tends to pretend or actually may not even have been aware. So making such a test mandatory before marriage may help,\" This test is as important as kundlis: In Mumbai, a large section of people, especially youngsters, are of the opinion that the test must be made mandatory. \"People are worried to ask a potential groom in particular for a test, lest it upsets him and his family. But, it's as important as checking the kundlis in current times,\" says 26-year-old Tina Raina, a computer professional. A thought echoed by may others. Dr I S Gilada, President of AIDS Society of India, who has been working in this field for almost three decades, emphasises, \"This step may upset some people in our traditional society who might even call of a marriage. It's mainly young unsuspecting women who suffer in this. Human rights activists may say that declaring HIV status of one person to the other is violation of his/ her privacy. But doesn\u2019t the potential spouse have a right to be protected from the disease? One\u2019s right to privacy cannot infringe upon another\u2019s right to life. In fact if it is made mandatory, there will be more awareness and more people going in for regular checkups.\" What's the solution: Instead of just an HIV test, a couple about to get married could undergo a comprehensive health check-up that includes tests for diabetes, thalassemia, haemophilia and other sexually transmitted diseases. \"This way we can ensure better medical compatibility between partners. And even if a partner tests positive for HIV, he/she can be rejected only as 'medically unfit' and won't have to carry the stigma of an HIV/AIDS patient. Vice-verse, if they decide to go ahead with the marriage, it is with fullest knowledge and understanding, so they can\u2019t blame anyone,\" says Gilada. States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Goa in the past attempted to bring about such a rule, but could not succeed. Will Maharashtra manage to do it? Let's see... Raima Sen, actress: If such a bill is being considered, I\u2019m glad it is because we definitely need this, especially in areas where education levels are low. Many suffer because of not having knowledge and rather than that suffering, it\u2019s better you are aware of things beforehand. Siddharth Dhanvant Shangvi, author: There\u2019s no clear-cut answer. In principle it seems logical enough: both partners should make an informed decision. But by legalising the process, not only do you bring the state into the bedroom, you also stigmatise HIV further. After all, there are many conditions that must be ascertained before we enter a partnership. Why aren\u2019t those investigated? Nandana Sen, actress: Making the test mandatory could intensify the inhuman stigmatisation that HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients grapple with. Brides and grooms must be encouraged to take the test before marriage, but it should be voluntary. Rakhi Sawant, TV actress: I totally agree with the government and feel everybody must go for a check-up every six months. Nowadays, people are indulging in all kinds of vices. Today, a wife doesn\u2019t know if her husband has been in a relationship with another man or woman! Anushka Manchanda, singer: In our country, where there is still a very prevalent arranged marriage system, a mandatory HIV test would be a boon. Due to our conservative society, these questions are barely asked. Mugdha Godse, actress: Alarming statistics show how children suffer because of their parents being HIV positive and women who not find out if their husbands are HIV positive suffer. It\u2019s thus best to be aware. Sahil Shroff, actor and model: Everyone should get an AIDS test; the government should organise this free of cost and have an awareness campaign on sex education. What is more of a concern, is how we treat those who are AIDS victims. Mukul Dev, actor: I totally support this move to have an HIV test before marriage; especially when one is beginning a family. It will also be a step towards removing the taboo attached with AIDS. Hansika, actress: I agree with the move. Some families may not like it because they are traditional. I feel the issue is personal."

Also, they will talk about ways in which they could influence policy makers to plan welfare, security and rehabilitation of people with AIDS."

To hold the event, IIML joined hands with the Uttar Pradesh State Aids Control Society (UPSACS). The nukkad natak is a popular method of spreading social awareness due to its effectiveness in crowd gathering and involvement. With World AIDS Day only two weeks away, it was perfect time for UPSACS and IIML to remind the city of the importance of taking the first step towards protection from AIDS. Top three teams from several colleges from across the city were shortlisted on the basis of their scripts. People laughed, cried and stared in wonder at the storytelling. The event was judged by Mridula Bharadwaj, secretary, National Institute of Progressive Arts. The finals will be held on Friday, 10 am onwards. Being organised successfully for over 15 years, INDEX has a number of theme-based game stalls apart from entertainment and on-the-spot competitions. The games are so designed that they bring out all relevant information from participants who have no clue they are actually respondents in a survey-based study. Participants go through various levels, answering different questions which students record carefully on the spot and the data is analysed for results."

        "body": "RANCHI: Jharkhand has some good news on World AIDS Day with a Naco report showing that HIV prevalence rate in the state in 2011 was 0.25%, lower than the national average of 0.27%. However, the bad news in disguise is that the rate has increased from 0.21% in 2010. An official of JSACS said on condition of anonymity that the rising number of cases can be controlled only through awareness programmes. \"The main reason for the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the state is migration and trafficking along with lack of awareness about the disease. Most of the time people from rural areas go to other states to work as labourers and get (infected by) HIV and when they come back, they, at times, transmit it to those whom they come in contact with,\" he said. The adult HIV prevalence rate in the state was only 0.14% in 2007, which increased to 0.16% in 2008, 0.18% in 2009, 0.21% in 2010 and now to 0.25% in 2011. On the other hand, the national average of adult HIV prevalence rate declined from 0.33% in 2007 to 0.31% in 2008, 0.30% in 2009 and 0.28% in 2010 and now to 0.27% in 2011. According to the Naco HIV Estimate Report 2012, there were 23,800 HIV positive patients in the state in 2007, which increased to 28,300 in 2008, 33,800 in 2009, 40,200 in 2010 and 48,000 in 2011. In India, number of HIV positive people has declined from 22.5 lakh in 2007 to 21.9 lakh in 2008, 21.4 lakh in 2009, 21.1 lakh in 2010 and 20.9 lakh in 2011. The report also says number of HIV positive cases registered in Jharkhand in 2011 is the third highest among other states. \"We will take out a rally on Sunday on the occasion of World AIDS Day to spread awareness among people,\" said the official quoted above. The Jharkhand State AIDS Control Society (JSACS) has taken various steps for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. There are 64 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) in the state and six anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres. Besides adults, these six ART centres cater to 844 children below 15 years of age. The additional project director of JSACS, BP Chaurasia, was not available for comment."

According to estimates, there are 66,000 IDUs in the northeast. As per HIV Sentinel Surveillance data, IDUs constitute 1.46% of the high-risk group for HIV. Kailash Ditya, deputy team leader of Project Sunrise, a project that oversees a prison intervention program (PIP) for high risk groups among prisoners, told TOI that 40 inmates at Guwahati Central Jail with a history of IDUs have been tested for HIV/AIDS since January. \"We are working on to bring down demand, supply and harm reduction among the inmates. There is also risk assessment at the same time among the inmates\" said Ditya. Though harm reduction programmes (HRN) and oral/opiod substitution therapy (OST) is gaining ground in HIV-afflicted states like Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Mizoram, reaching OST to all parts of the northeast is a challenge because 84% of the population in the northeast resides in rural areas. \"The Centre has to initiate a surveillance system for HCV at the earliest. IDUs are most vulnerable to HCV. There is no data of how many are affected. There is the need for estimation and study of the disease burden of HCV. Without estimation, proper policy cannot be formulated,\" said Ketholelie Angami, the chairperson of Northeast Hepatitis C Forum."

The software is currently under trial in Bellary, Kolar and Udupi districts, and will be put in place at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) in all 30 districts of the state. \"It's mandatory for all pregnant women to go to ICTCs and get themselves tested. If any would-be mother is diagnosed HIV positive, we'll start monitoring her from the 14{+t},{+h}, week of gestation. Thereafter, she goes to the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres and gets herself treated. The software will help us keep track of the mother and the child till the infant turns 18 months old,\" said Dr BV Karur, additional project director, KSAPS. The software developed by the National Informatics Centre is being evaluated for its promptness. \"Training is on at various districts, and healthcare officials are being briefed on how to use the software. The process is simple - when a pregnant woman comes for check-up, her contact details are noted down. If she is found to be HIV positive, the healthcare provider keeps communicating with her to make sure she comes for treatment regularly,\" said Dr Lalita Hande, who has worked towards developing the software. ENCOURAGING NUMBERS * The state has a 0.22% prevalence of HIV among pregnant women * Going by data collated in 2010-11, HIV prevalence among general population is 0.69%, a decline from 1.5% in 2003-04"

The 35-year-old terminally ill Naswadi resident from Chhota Udepur district is an AIDS patient and developed abdominal tuberculosis along with a number of viral infections. She is among those many victims who never found a chance to live normally through anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Radha was diagnosed with AIDS after her skin started erupting into lesions due to a viral infection. While her husband and son subsequently tested HIV positive, she became a victim of social stigmatization because of the very visible effects of her multiple disorders.The prevalence of HIV-AIDS patients in the tribal region poses a great hurdle in controlling the transmission of the virus and registration of new cases, doctors at the SSG Hospital claim. According to records of patients coming to SSG for ART and their follow-ups, many families with multiple HIV positive members exist in the tribal areas, most of whom are not diagnosed early. This is leading them to perpetuate the ongoing HIV epidemic.\"Radha's 42-year-old husband left her to fend for herself and their son and she gradually stopped her treatment. Unfortunately, cases like hers are common in the tribal belts. There is a majority of patients who discontinue their treatments posing a threat of spreading the virus,\" said Dr Y S Marfatia, head of department of skin and venereal diseases at SSG Hospital, \"Adolescent health programmes are yet to make an impact on the population that is largely illiterate. Most HIV carriers are unaware of their condition and spread the disease to their spouses and then children. We devote in a lot of time to convince patients to take the test. HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,\" said Dr Mohammed Hussain, who handles HIV patients at SSG Hospital.The department is working towards 'Getting to Zero: zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, and zero AIDS related deaths' - in an attempt to bring down the cases of failure to follow-up and last stage detections."

A joint venture of railways and the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), it will leave for Chopan in UP on Friday evening. Lauding the railways and NACO, Yadav said the Red Ribbon Express would help create awareness about Aids, HIV and other diseases among common people.

While four bogies are dedicated to display items related to Aids and HIV, two others are meant for counselling and test purposes, he said. The counselling and test bogies are well equipped. There is a provision for free HIV and Aids test of all those who volunteer for the same. Also, experienced counsellors give tips on certain measures to prevent the disease. There are 60-odd personnel, including the counsellors, aboard the train. The four display bogies impressively throw light on the root causes of the disease and on the measures being taken by NACO to check the spread of Aids. Two special buses, travelling along with Red Ribbon Express, go to the villages adjacent to the station at which the train has halted, to show films through audio visual system and create awareness among villagers about Aids and HIV. The train is scheduled to travel to 141 districts in 22 states across the country. Before reaching Bihar, the train covered 13 states and at least 40 lakh people have visited it so far.

Sister Britto, the director of Snehadeep Centre of the Holy Cross Community Care Centre and Hospital, over 15 km from Hazaribag, said the they provided medicines, food and accommodation to 40 to 50 patients suffering from HIV. \"But now, we have been compelled to withdraw the facilities as the Naco felt all such patients should go to the ART Centre functioning on the Sadar Hospital campus.\" The funds provided by the Naco up to March 31 have stopped, she said. More than 90% HIV patients admitted to the centre were discharged as there was no money to meet the expenses of the patients. Since the treatment facility started in 2005, the centre has treated 3,431 patients. However, the Holy Cross Society has started taking care of poor and critical patients by meeting 50% of the expenses incurred on these patients on humanitarian grounds. The remaining 50% of the expenses are met by the suffering patients with great difficulties. Sister Britto said despite some assistance from the Society, they were compelled to release two doctors and seven nurses whose salaries were paid from the funds provided by the Naco. The number of HIV patients in Hazaribag district has gone up to 1,799. ''We bear 50% of the costs ourselves here since the care and treatment they receive were unparalleled,\" said a patient from Barkatha and Koderma. Sister Britto said, ''We are running 11 centres in Hazaribag and Koderma districts for creating awareness against HIV/Aids and its implication. In all these centres, counseling of people is being done.\" Asked whether she approached the Jharkhand government for assistance following this crisis, she said she met principal secretary, health, K Vidyasagar, North Chotonagpur divisional commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni and others to acquaint them with the problem. \"The officials advised me to approach the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM).\""

And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the BSACS officials! On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in Chhapra was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application. The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive. \u201cI went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can\u2019t ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What\u2019s worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I\u2019m desperate,\u201d she said over the phone. Exactly 14 days ago, I happened to visit the Chhapra ART centre with RTI activist Sanjeet Singh, where the persons concerned told us that stocks were low. \u201cWe are just not receiving adequate stocks from BSACS, and we struggle to do what we can,\u201d they said. \u201cThe high court has decreed that every ART centre should have a two-month stock of ART medicines and medicines for opportunistic infections, but despite assurances from BSACS officials, see the situation!\u201d says Sanjeet. In Chhapra, the situation is overwhelming. Last month 1748 patients received ART. There are about 150 children on ART. NACO guidelines are not met. BSACS has not appointed the required staff. No medical officer, so obviously, no \u2018accountable\u2019 official! Pregnant women have to buy their own \u2018safe delivery kits\u2019 from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, \u201cSo far, no such case has been brought to our notice.\u201d There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, \u201cMy child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.\u201d Just as I write the finishing line to this article, Saturday 8am, I receive a phone call. The ART medicines have finally arrived, and will be given out today. Happy Mother\u2019s Day!"

They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression. Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports. \u201cThe hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,\u201d Raju told TOI. Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. \u201cThe blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings \u2014 they showed she was HIV-positive \u2014 and underwent stress and psychological trauma,\u201d said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable. The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. \u201cICTC\u2019s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,\u201d said Prahlad. Sushmitha\u2019s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn\u2019t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report. Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. \u201cIn Halappa\u2019s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can\u2019t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,\u201d he said. Cases pending before court: Hospital When TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. \u201cThe cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we can\u2019t comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry,\u201d said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital. \u2018Negligence cases not under KPME Act\u2019 In 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. \u201cBut the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration. Medical negligence cases don\u2019t come under it,\u201d said Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere."

        "body": "MYSURU: Self-confidence and moral support can beat all odds in life. A classic example is that of Keshava (name changed). The 42-year-old has been an HIV positive since 2004 and initially he was in a bad condition. Doctors too had given up on him. But today, Keshava is leading a dignified life. He could walk over 3km a day without any support. \"I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,\" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added. His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). \"If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,\" she says. Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family. Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. \"Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,\" said Sathyavathi. The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012. Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. \"The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,\" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy. The palliative care facility has served 345 bedridden patients suffering from cancer, paralysis, spinal cord injury, severe neurological disorders, hypertension, gangrene, kidney failure, cerebral palsy and other illnesses since 2011. Initially, 88 patients were inducted into the programme. Palliative care operates with a team approach consisting of doctors, nurses, counsellors, social workers and volunteers visiting each patient's home and providing a holistic care for patients to improve the quality of life by using an array of skills at their doorstep."

KGMU is one of the few centers in India that use Nucleic Acid Test (NAT), a WHO recommended gold standard for screening of blood samples and early detection of HIV, especially among infants. \u201cThe usual HIV testing is done using Elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test which is inferior to NAT. This means that several cases of HIV which may not be detected by Elisa are detected by NAT. Also, NAT can detect HIV in a person almost six months earlier than ELISA,\u201d said Prof Tulika Chandra, head of transfusion in medicine department, KGMU. But NAT is yet to be adopted by the department of health and family welfare and state health department. ( Simran Tandon)"

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Eradication of polio and HIV/AIDS has been two major successes in health sector in India. On World Hepatitis Day on Monday, World Health Organization called for using similar strategies and infrastructure to check the spread of infection caused by Hepatitis viruses. The issue was discussed at the first roundtable consultation on viral hepatitis organized by WHO at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. \"The HIV/AIDS programme in India has been successful mainly because of its robust sentinel surveillance mechanism, involvement of community health workers and NGOs to spread awareness and availability of free drugs. These strategies and infrastructure can be used to spread awareness about Hepatitis B and C that follow similar modes of transmission,\" said Dr Nicole Seguy, technical advisor at the WHO country office. There are five main hepatitis viruses, of which B and C cause the most fatalities as these can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Dr Seguy said preventive measures such as compulsory vaccination for Hepatitis B, promoting safe sex and screening of blood for infections at the time of transfusion can help check the spread of diseases. \"Though there is treatment available for Hepatitis C, few can afford it. The government should make efforts to subsidize or make drugs available for free to those infected,\" she added. Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, said a key recommendation made by the experts group at the WHO meet was that the government should utilize services of 17,000 HIV surveillance centres for screening Hepatitis B and C patients. \"If one person in the family has Hepatitis B, chances of others having it are high. It is important to screen them for the virus before vaccination because the vaccines can only protect uninfected patients,\" he said. Nata Menabde, WHO representative to India, also stressed on the need for reliable information on viral hepatitis for building prevention and control measures. \"WHO calls upon all partners and stakeholders to make the 'silent' epidemic of viral hepatitis more visible and more manageable,\" she said. \"We have had massive awareness campaigns for polio, HIV or tuberculosis in our country. Hepatitis is also one such disease which can be prevented to a large extent if people know about it,\" said Dr S K Acharya, HOD, gastroenterology, at AIIMS. According to him, patients get to know about the disease at a very late stage."

The antiretroviral regimen for treating the mothers is much more expensive and requires access to medical facilities that aren't widely available in developing countries such as Malawi, The baby regimen, in comparison, is incredibly cheap and much easier to implement. These findings are important because each year about 200,000 infants worldwide become infected with HIV through breastfeeding, and in the developing world infant formula is both prohibitively expensive and associated with increased infant deaths,\" the study's author Charles van der Horst said. In the study, 2,369 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs in Malawi, were randomly assigned to one of three groups -- a maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) group, a second group in which infants were treated with nevirapine liquid and control group for whom medications were given at the time of delivery only. None of these women had developed AIDS yet and thus did not need treatment for their own health. After their babies were born, women in the maternal antiretroviral group received a single tablet twice a day containing the drugs zidovudine and lamivudine. They also received a dose of nevirapine by mouth once a day for 14 days and then twice daily from 2 to 28 weeks. Follow us on Twitter for more stories"

The family, after spending nearly 20 days on the streets, were put back in their house by an NGO and the district administration. The family was evicted from their house on November 6 after a worker of an NGO, Jeevan Aadhar Community Care Centre, made it public to their neighbours that they were HIV positive. The head of the family, a mason, with his pregnant wife and four children where manhandled and thrown out of their house by neighbours. The entire family then shifted to Umaid Hospital as the woman suffered injuries and started bleeding when the neighbours pushed them out of the locality. The neighbours claimed that they would also get infected if the family continued to live there. Once out of the hospital, the family spent time wandering here and there in the city and finally made railway station their home where they were spotted by a local NGO, Jodhpur Network of People Living with AIDS. \"We initiated the efforts to rehabilitate them and brought the matter to the notice of the administration,\" said Dinesh Joshi of the NGO. On the interference of district collector Gaurav Goyal, some policemen from the concerned police station who had earlier refused to lent an ear to the woes of the family, went to the locality and warned the neighbours and re-accommodated the family in their house. \"We sent an official from social welfare department along with the police and resettled them in their house. Apart from this, we also ensured preventive action by the police against those who had thrown them out of the locality. We have also written to the State's AIDS Control Society complaining against the NGO Jeevan Aadhar Community Care Centre, whose worker made the mistake of informing about the family's HIV status to the neighbours,\" said Goyal Joshi told that the worker of the NGO, who made it public to the people, had visited the family as part of the periodic follow up of such cases. \"But it was the family, who had to suffer due to ignorance of that worker who made it public,\" said Joshi. He attributed the mistake to the lack of seriousness on the part of the NGO which did not educate the staff properly on such sensitive matter."

This week, a GR to this effect was sent to all the health centres in the state ahead of the World Hepatitis Day that was observed on Thursday. Principal health secretary Sujata Saunik said that the National Centre for Disease Control in 2014 had designed guidelines for safe injection practices, which the state has decided to adopt now. \u201cThe first step would be to transition from disposable to single use auto-disable syringes in the immunization programme so that any likelihood of syringe reuse is ruled out,\u201d Saunik said on the sidelines of a WHO event on Hepatitis Day on Thursday. \u201cIt will be complemented by extensive awareness about birth vaccination, training of healthcare workers on handling and maintenance of drugs and safe disposal of syringes. Timing of the vaccination is also of utmost importance.\u201d Unsafe injection practices such as reuse of syringes and needles is a leading cause of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B, C and HIV. Transfusion of unsafe blood is another route through which these infect people. It is estimated that over 1.15lakh people die of hepatitis B related complications every year in the country."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The same drug used for treating HIV can also prevent gay and bi-sexual men from getting infected in the first place. In a landmark study, announced on Tuesday, scientists have found that Truvada -- a single daily pill containing two drugs that is being used by HIV patients -- actually reduces the risk of contracting the virus by at least 44%. In what is being hailed as the biggest success in finding a prevention tool against the deadly HIV, the iPrEx study -- published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) -- found that those, who popped the pill more than 90% of the time, were 73% less susceptible to contract HIV. The study, which involved nearly 2500 high-risk gay men, is significant because it gives credence to an HIV prevention approach called oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves the use of anti-retrovirals (ART) by those who are HIV-negative and at high risk of infection. The findings come only a few months after an African study by the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) showed that a microbicidal gel can help protect women from contracting the virus. \"iPrEx has proved the concept of oral PrEP, and now its up to the field to build on this success and work towards realising the full potential of this promising approach in different at-risk populations, such as injection drug users and women. I am now convinced that there will be a day when we have several safe and effective methods for preventing HIV,\" said Sharon Hillier, professor and director of reproductive infectious disease research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The iPrEx study involved 2,499 participants from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, the US, South Africa and Thailand who were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: Truvada (a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine) or Placebo. All participants received safe sex counselling and free condoms, and were tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during their monthly visit right through the programme. Of the 1,248 participants assigned to the Placebo group, 64 acquired HIV during the study as compared to 36 of the 1,251 in the Truvada group. \"The findings of this study have immense implications for the entire HIV prevention field, but most notably for global efforts focused on the population of men who have sex with men engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse,\" said MTN investigator Ian McGowan. What about the concerns that people who take PrEP could develop drug resistance if they become infected with HIV? The researchers said, if someone became infected with HIV while using an ARV-based prevention strategy, then the patient's virus would be exposed to whatever ARV drug or drugs are being administered. Consequently, resistance to that drug could emerge."

        "body": "VISAKHAPATNAM: Over 1.5 lakh children in the state who have lost either one or both parents to HIV/AIDS and who have contracted the disease themselves have been left to fend for themselves, both financially and emotionally, due to the lack of government help and the social stigma still attached to the disease. What is most worrying is the psychological trauma they go through as they deal with the disease at such young age. According to a study taken up by the social work department of Andhra University (AU), nearly 60% of the HIV affected children surveyed were found to be grappling with psychological problems. The study was done in three districts with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS __ Krishna (2.7% of the population have HIV), Kadapa and Karimnagar (both with 1.7 % prevalence rate). \"There are around 1.5 lakh such 'AIDS orphans' in the state, according to the AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs),\" said research scholar Abraham Mutluri, who is doing the three-year-long study under the guidance of department head Prof ABSV Ranga Rao. \"However, there is no specific government home or institute for such children and the stigma associated with the disease makes it all the more difficult for the kids to find shelter, though in most cases NGOs give them shelter in some homes while some find a place with relatives or neighbours,\" said Mutluri. As many as 316 children in the 8-18 years age group in the three districts were selected for the study that is to be completed in August and is the first assessment of the condition of such children in the state. Of these, around 40% are HIV infected, the study showed. Besides, more than 60% of the kids are depressed, lonely, have extreme mood variations or show signs of some kind of psychological disorder, said the researcher. \"Sadly, in the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres, where the kids get free treatment, there are hardly any child psychologists to counsel them individually. The group counselling is inadequate,\" said Mutluri. Most of the kids are from poor families, where the father had been a trucker or migrant worker. \"In 65% of the cases, the widowed mothers migrate to parental homes to avoid the stigma and are forced to sell property for a paltry sum. The education of the children also suffers and many of them become dropouts,\" he said. In some cases, especially if one child is HIV positive, the siblings are separated and one of them is sent to a hostel while the other is taken by some relative, informed Prof Rao. All such changes affects the children psychologically which needs to be addressed."

Dr US Sooch, district programme officer of HIV-AIDS prevention, said: \u201cImparting awareness to mothers to openly discuss their problems with doctors is helping a lot. As such mothers are motivated, they take medicines regularly, and the fixed dose is continued for a lifetime. When a baby is six weeks old, an HIV test is done. If it turns out to be negative, then the test is done again at six months, and again at 18 months if it is negative. If even after 18 months, the test comes out negative again, then the child is declared HIV-free. Now, if the test turns out positive in six weeks, then the medicine (single dose) is started, and after the HIV test at six months, if it is positive again, then a final test is done at 18 months, and if it is positive again, then the medicine is given for a lifetime.\u201d Sooch further said that earlier, HIV positive women and children were given a single dose at the time of delivery. But now, the treatment is started in pregnancy itself, if the woman is declared HIV-positive, and the medicine for a pregnant mother is a fixed dose combination, but for a child, the single dose continues as earlier. So, less than 5% cases of transfer of disease from mother to child are found, whereas the rest 95% newborn are all safe. CURRENT TREATMENT Treatment during pregnancy: One tablet \u2014 a combination of three ARV (anti-retro viral) medicines \u2014 is given to a pregnant mother at night after meal. Treatment for HIV-positive mother is life-long. Test done for child/newborn: First at six weeks, then at six months, and then at 18 months. The medicine, however, is started right from birth itself. Fall in number of cases: With this new fixed doze combination of medicines, chances of an HIV-positive child being born has come down from 10-20% to less than 5% where mothers took the treatment."

While 1,091 men succumbed to AIDS, the health problem resulted in the end of life for 379 women and 47 children. To a query under the Right to Information Act, the KSACS revealed that 19,905 persons were tested positive for HIV infection during this period. A total of 3,700 men were diagnosed with AIDS in this period, and the number of women and children who were affected was 2,354 and 320 respectively. The highest number of positive cases was reported in Thiruvananthapuram - 4,034: 2,126 men, 1,489 women and 219 children. Thrissur came second with 3,426 cases: 1,865 men, 1,376 women and 185 children, while Kozhikode reported 2,953 cases: 1,694 men, 1,097 women and 162 children. A total of 899 children were registered at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres, the KSACS officials said in reply to the RTI query filed by advocate D B Binu. According to the data of 2011, 61 children were found to be positive, with 12 each in Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur and 10 in Kozhikode. The rate of infection is coming down in the state even though more cases are being detected because of the awareness among the public. \"Based on our research, Kerala has an estimated 40,000 HIV cases, but we have only identified 19,000-odd cases, so the other cases are lying hidden. Our effort is to bring out these people. We have brought out many campaigns for it, and that is how there is an increase in the number of reported cases,\" says Dr K Shylaja, project director of KSACS. What alarms the authorities is the rise in the number of cases among the young generation. Unlike in the past, the high-risk group's definition has changed. Instead of sex workers and truck drivers, youths seem to carry the infection the most nowadays. \"Casual relations and a tendency to adopt Western culture in general could be the reasons for this increase in cases among youths. We are targeting them with our campaigns and educational programmes, \"said Dr K Shylaja. But not many agree with the statistics provided by the KSACS. According to agencies working in this sector, new cases are being reported from across the state now. \"Many teenagers are coming to ART centres now, and their cases can't be as old as the officials claim them to be.

To add to this, the ongoing mapping in rural parts will possibly take the figure to 2 lakh or more, say officials. Previous surveys had estimated the number of sex workers in the state at 1-1.2 lakh, clearly indicating that the number is on the rise. As per the survey, there are 22,000 female sex workers and 4,000 Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) in Greater Hyderabad. The survey, costing Rs 1.5 crore and funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was primarily carried out to saturate the HIV/Aids prevalence among this group. So far, APSACS has been unable to initiate steps to control the prevalence of the disease as 50 per cent of the population was out of bounds for the agency. Now, armed with the data after the scientific mapping exercise, APSACS has scaled up the interventions for this untapped population. \"We have 38 new interventions now to ensure that the practice of safe sex is followed and the high risk groups go for routine medical check ups to check their HIV status in Hyderabad,\" said Kailash Aditya, joint director (targeted interventions), APSACS. As part of this, police is also being sensitised to nab traffickers and pimps instead of sex workers. Quoting the 2008-09 data, authorities said that 11 per cent of the sex workers were found to be HIV positive in the state. Besides, the HIV/Aids prevalence among MSMs was a significant 23 per cent. To contain the numbers from going up further, this updated data would come in handy to plan and scale up the interventions. AP has an estimated 5.4 lakh people living with HIV/Aids. The survey also revealed that several massage and beauty parlours were actually involved in sex trade. This apart, the organised business is now operating from residential apartments. It was also revealed that 65 per cent of the soliciting is now taking place through mobile phones. While more than 50 per cent of sex work is still street-based, around 40 per cent is home-based, with the remaining being brothel-based and lodge-based. The highest number of sex workers were found in the towns of Krishna, Kurnool, Guntur, West Godavari, Chittoor and Visakhapatnam districts."

The children, aged between three and 12 years, were denied admission to a prominent school in Gurgaon last year on \u2018medical grounds\u2019 and even the government school they have been shifted to is threatening to remove them as they are HIV positive. The NGO looking after them has alleged that the kids are treated poorly at their school and are mocked at by fellow children. \u201cThe students call us \u2018bimari\u2019. Even the teachers do not help. They often scold us and make us work,\u201d said 12-year-old Amit (name changed), who studies in Class VI at Rajkiya Vidyalaya in Bhondsi, Haryana. Another 11-year-old child, who has no memories of his parents or where he was born, says teachers discriminate against him. \u201cThey make us clean the classroom, do gardening work and often scold us. They ask us why we keep taking medicines and beat us up if we protest,\u201d he alleged, adding that he has no illness and is healthy like any other child. According to Sunita Gupta, chairperson of NGO Drone Foundation which looks after these children, the teacher in-charge of the government-run school has warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest. \u201cThe children feel scared to go to school. I met the principal some days ago and he threatened disciplinary action as the school was not informed about the fact that these children were HIV positive. They are being harassed,\u201d she claimed. Gupta added that the children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009. \u201cThough the school administration was supportive in the beginning, due to pressure from parents of other children and teachers, they asked us to make alternate arrangement for their education in August. One academic year was lost as all other schools had closed admissions by then,\u201d she said. When contacted, principal of DPS Maruti Kunj Rachna Pandit said that the children were never admitted to the school. \u201cSuch children need special care. We talked to doctors and experts about their emergency needs and care, and finally decided to drop them as we do not have expertise in dealing with such cases. There have been instances when these children got hurt while playing and the bleeding did not stop,\u201d said Pandit. On the allegations of discrimination at the government school, Gurgaon\u2019s district education officer Jyoti Choudhary said she was not aware of this case. \u201cUnder the Right to Education Act, no children can be discriminated against,\u201d she said. Dr Bir Singh, professor of the community medicine department at AIIMS who has worked with Unicef, said that HIV positive children do not require any special care in schools. \u201cThey are healthy and need regular medication, including vitamins and tablets, to prevent opportunistic infections,\u201d he said.

Other countries, including Armenia, China, Fiji, Moldova, Namibia and Ukraine have also recently removed such restrictions. \u201cTravel restrictions on individuals with HIV are unnecessary and hinder the ability for individuals and companies to operate in a truly global workforce,\u201d said Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna. Most HIV-travel restrictions were imposed by governments in the 1980s when little was known about the transmission of HIV, and treatment didn\u2019t exist. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve learned how to effectively prevent, manage and treat HIV,\u201d UNAIDS said. \u201cRestrictions on entry, stay and residence for people living with HIV are discriminatory and a violation of human rights,\u201d said Michel Sidib\u00e9, executive director of UNAIDS. \u201cEvery individual should have equal access to freedom of movement. I urge all countries to remove all such restrictions based on HIV status,\u201d he added. \u201cHIV travel restrictions are discriminatory and bad for business,\u201d said Chip Bergh, president of Levi Strauss & Co. There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries \u2014 Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, UAE and Yemen. Five countries -- Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10\u201390 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative. Laws in 20 countries including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV. Even in the epidemic\u2019s fourth decade globally, nearly 4 in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination. The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS, says that the effects of such restrictions are most severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. From 2005 to 2010, the number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million. The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2013 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas. \u201cThose who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants\u2019 HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as permanently unfit to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,\u201d the report said. India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010. In 2002, the health ministry had issued a notification stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, 2010 the ministry of external affairs clarified that there were no travel or residency restrictions for people living with HIV coming to India."

The complaint states that the sign affixed to the patient\u2019s bed displayed \u2018insensitivity and stigma\u2019 towards the patient. The letter, written by the organisation\u2019s founder and CEO Peter Borges, states that \u201cthis is completely unbecoming, inhuman and unexpected in the healthcare setting. This will not only increase stigma and discrimination, but also deter thousands of people living with HIV from accessing treatment\u201d. Borges said people, including those with HIV, expect from GMC healthcare services that are decent, respectful and free of prejudice and stigma. The plaint has also been sent to the project director of Goa state aids control society, GMC dean Dr Pradeep Naik, its medical superintendent, Dr Shivanand Bandekar and director of health services, Dr Sanjeev Dalvi. The complaint attached TOI\u2019s August 29 report headlined \u2018GMC reveals identity of HIV+ man, kin in trauma\u2019.

The victims say DM Sanjay Bansal was sitting in his car a few metres away when the assault happened but he denies this. The two had to be hospitalized for their injuries but the police seemed to be going slow in the case. Till late Monday, officers refused to answer on what charges the accused policemen had been booked, if at all. Sources say two accused cops have been taken off guard duty on the initiative of the DM. The victims are members of the Peoples Network for HIV-Positive, which is holding its statewide convention at Kolkata\u2019s Esplanade on April 20.

        "body": "Nagpur: City doctors will now not only be able to test HIV positive patients for tuberculosis (TB) within two hours, but will also know whether patients are resistant to the conventional TB drugs (Rifampicin), a condition known as MDR-TB. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) runs TB centre at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) since 2007. Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity. The centre has already procured the CBNAAT equipment (commonly called as gene Xpert) under the RNTCP. It will be installed in a specially created laboratory for it in the IGGMC premises on March 24. Dr Sadaf Khateeb, medical officer of NMC\u2019s TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB. \"Under the RNTCP programme, and as per WHO guidelines, we have been told to put all co-infected or HIV positive and suspected TB patient to this test. This can diagnose the patient for TB in general as well as the multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB within two hours. Since the instrument generates an automated report, the test can be conducted even by a laboratory technician,\" she said. Though the centre is meant for only patients living within NMC limits, all patients found to be HIV positive at the Anti-Retro-viral Therapy (ART) centre of IGGMC, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or other NMC hospitals can be referred for TB and MDR-TB diagnosis here. \u201cGeneral TB patients still have to be diagnosed using the culture test, which takes about 3-5 months. But HIV positive patients suspected to be suffering from TB cannot be made to wait so much. Hence, such patients from all over the city, region and neighbouring states who come to government hospitals here can be sent to the NMC centre,\u201d said Dr Khateeb. He said that cases of non-pulmonary (or non-lung) TB patients are on the rise in general but their percentage is higher in HIV positive patients. They are commonly diagnosed with abdominal TB, cervical lymph nodes (on the neck) etc. The HIV positive patients who are suffering from TB generally test negative in conventional smear test. But with CBNAAT, it will now be possible to easily diagnose them for TB or MDR-TB as soon as their ART treatment is started once they are referred to the NMC centre. In 2014, the centre had registered over 200 TB patients. Of these, 95% were tested for MDR and some 25-30 patients were HIV positive too. Hence, CBNAAT is set to change the diagnosis and naturally the treatment scenario of HIV positive and TB patients for the better. Help HIV+ * CBNAAT is a molecular diagnostic test to detect TB or MDR-TB in a person within two hours * CBNAAT is very sensitive and precise * Since 2007, when NMC-TB Centre was set up, it has found 239 MDR-TB cases * Of these, 54 are still under treatment at the centre * Of the 54 MDR-TB cases, 11 are HIV positive and under treatment"

        "body": "CHENNAI: Twenty-five years after the first case of HIV/AIDS was reported in the country, experts say the main target in the fight against the disease is misconceptions. After releasing the 13th Behaviour Surveillance Survey Round XIII for 2011, experts in the field said that awareness among the public had gone up but awareness without misconception was low. Many believe that healthy-looking people have a good immune system and may not test positive for HIV/AIDS. Doctors have been trying to tell people that antiretroviral drugs \u2014 the medicines of choice for HIV/AIDS \u2014 will only keep the viral load low, but many assume they are safe after taking them. \u201cWe require schemes to target misconceptions. Only awareness without misconceptions will strengthen the fight against HIV,\u201d said AIDS Prevention And Control (APAC) project director Dr Bimal Charles. Dr Charles said that in the surveys, people had said cleaning the vagina with vinegar or having sex with monkeys would keep out the infection. The annual survey report, by APAC project along with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and USAID, has been prepared since 1996. The survey is conducted among high-risk groups like female sex workers, gays and injecting drug users and bridge population groups such as truckers and migrant workers. With a sample size of 5,000, the field work was done in November and December 2011 across 15 towns in Tamil Nadu. The results showed a significant improvement in the behaviour among targeted groups where NGOs were working. Most field workers had reasons to smile: condom use among female sex workers had gone up from 95.7% to 98.5%; 96.1% of gays reported using condoms during sex with commercial partners, 91% of gays reported taking HIV test in the last one year; the proportion of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) who reported sharing needles and syringes with their partners reduced from 43.3% in the last round of BSS to 31.6% in the current round; and a lesser number of truckers (28.5%) reported seeking services of commercial sex workers when compared to earlier survey (45.1%). But there is still a need for improvement. For instance, though condom use is high among casual and regular clients, it remains low among regular partners; many counselling services aren\u2019t adequately used; and the changing patterns of sex workers have excluded some women from the intervention programmes."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The Centre's decision to put conditions while extending crucial second line antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all HIV patients invited sharp criticism from the Supreme Court on Friday. It said when it is a matter of life or death, there can be no discrimination in treatment. In an affidavit before the SC, National AIDS Control Authority (NACO) said second line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners. It said such persons were either switched to second line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases. NACO's attempt to broadbase its second line treatment by excluding those who had little hope of surviving for long was, prima facie, unpalatable to a Bench of Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar, which was hearing a PIL filed by NGO Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust. \"We cannot go by this discrimination. Right to life is a constitutional right,\" it said. Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam explained that world over, it was a common practice that there had to be a rationale for HIV patients for their upgradation from first line to second line treatment. He supplemented NACO's affidavit, which said, \"Irrational treatment prescribed by private medical practitioners where persons are switched to second line treatment without any evidence of treatment failure to first line ART leads to early drug resistance and consequent risk of transmission of resistant virus.\" NACO said about 70 hospitals had informed it that there were 24,212 persons on ART, of which 1,074 were put on second line treatment due to toxicity of first line drugs and another 2,173 because of treatment failure. With the PIL claiming that over 15,000 patients were currently receiving second line treatment from private clinics/practitioners, the Bench said, \"How can a person be punished if he is incorrectly treated upon by a private practitioner. Under Article 21, whether this argument can stand has to be seen. People are going to die and this cannot happen.\" The anguish of the court forced the government to seek 10 days time to do a rethink. The Centre agreed to call for details from all private hospitals and clinics and file a fresh affidavit."

However, for the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS), this was the best time to organize 10-day health camps, with HIV testing facilities, in districts which see a large population migrating to bigger cities for work. The results of the tests were an eye opener as high prevalence of HIV infection was found among the migrating population. The health department officials were shocked to find that the wives of these workers, many of them pregnant, also tested HIV positive. At least 65 cases of HIV were detected at the health camps set up in nine districts between November 1 and November 10. These districts were Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Sriganganagar, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali, Sikar and Udaipur. Those who tested positive for HIV were unaware that they were being infected with the virus, which once again stresses on the need for strengthening HIV surveillance in the districts. Project director (AIDS) Dr JP Dhamija said, \"It was the best time for launching the HIV testing in nine districts as large number of out-migratory people return to their homes to celebrate Diwali. We did not force them for HIV testing but they voluntarily came at the health camps organized in the respective areas. The camps were successful as we tested 15,975 persons for HIV.\" Several pregnant women were found to be infected with HIV virus. In Sikar district, a pregnant woman was immediately referred to a hospital to prevent transmission of virus to the fetus. Two more pregnant women tested positive for HIV in Nagaur."

An open letter from Charlie Sheen: Roughly four years ago, I suddenly found myself in the throws of a seismic and debilitating three-day cluster-migraine-like headache. I was emergently hospitalized with what I believed to be a brain tumor or perhaps some unknown pathology. I was partially correct. Following a battery of endless tests, that included a hideous spinal tap, it was sadly and shockingly revealed to me that I was, in fact, positive for HIV. The news was a \"mule kick\" to my soul. Those impossible words I absorbed and then tried to convince myself, that I was stuck, suspended, or even stranded inside some kind of alternate reality or nightmare, were to the absolute contrary. I was awake. It was true\u2026 reality. Under the brilliant and perfect care of Dr. Robert Huizenga as well as \"the\" leading infectious disease expert in the known universe, I began a rigorous and intensive treatment program. Not missing a beat, a med dose, or one shred of guidance, quickly my viral loads became undetectable. Like every other challenge in my life, again, I was victorious and kicking this disease's ass. I wish my story had ended there. Unfortunately, for my family and myself, it had only just begun. (As quoted by today.com) The personal disbelief, karmic confusion, shame and anger lead to a temporary yet abysmal descent into profound substance abuse and fathomless drinking. It was a suicide run. Problem was, I'd forgotten that I'm too tough for such a cowardly departure. Yet, despite this loathsome and horrific odyssey, I was vigilant with my anti-viral program. READ: Charlie Sheen says he is HIV positive My medical team could only shake their heads as each and every blood test returned levels revealing a state of remission. Even though I might have been trying to kill myself, one thing was radically evident; the disease was not. In and around this perplexing and difficult time, I dazedly chose (or hired) the companionship of unsavory and insipid types. Regardless of their salt-less reputations, I always lead with condoms and honesty when it came to my condition. Sadly, my truth soon became their treason, as a deluge of blackmail and extortion took center stage in this circus of deceit. To date, I have paid out countless millions to these desperate charlatans. Locked in a vacuum of fear, I chose to allow their threats and skulduggery to vastly deplete future assets from my children, while my \"secret\" sat entombed in their hives of folly (or so I thought). News Flash: This ends today. I'm claiming back my freedom. The scales of justice will swiftly and righteously re-balance themselves. In conclusion, I accept this condition not as a curse or scourge, but rather as an opportunity and a challenge. An opportunity to help others. A challenge to better myself. Every day, of every month, of every year, countless individuals go to work, man their stations, fulfill their professional obligations with a host of disabilities. Diseases, imperfections, hurdles, detours. These maladies range from lupus to cancer, from paralysis to blindness, from diabetes to obesity. \"Treated,\" HIV is no different. My partying days are behind me. My philanthropic days are ahead of me. Ernest Hemingway once wrote, \"Courage is grace under pressure.\" I've served my time under pressure; I now embrace the courage, and the grace.

        "body": "An infected needle turned Arun\u2019s* life upside down. In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhika\u2019s* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of AIDS research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society. \"When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,\" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. \"She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,\" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking. Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. \"I hadn\u2019t told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didn\u2019t want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,\" says Arun, an engineer. Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career \u2014 as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married \u2014 she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played \u2018matchmaker\u2019 for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika\u2019s was the first success story. With Dr Solomon\u2019s encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That\u2019s when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind. Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. \"I didn\u2019t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,\" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun\u2019s family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language. But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. \"We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,\" says Arun. Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun\u2019s family, or their son. \"There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,\" says Radhika. \"But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,\" says Radhika. Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. \"If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,\" he says. He has just one word of advice for people. \"If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life.\" (*Names have been changed to protect identity)"

        "body": "MUMBAI: A practically broke Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) has asked NGOs to curtail their HIV prevention activities in the state and do away with a significant chunk of their workforce. Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit. The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries. The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state\u2019s most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested. The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that NACO had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment. MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less. Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO\u2019s annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent. The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. \u201cCBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?\u201d asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects. The crisis has also reached the state body\u2019s doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC). \u201cIt is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?\u201d questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. \u201cWe suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,\u201d said a Pune-based NGO\u2019s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants. When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. \u201cWe have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments.

        "body": "KOLKATA: An HIV- positive person was found lying in a pool of blood by son at his hospital cabin in the School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Thursday morning. His abdomen was cut in such a way that his intestines were visible. Immediate medical attention failed to revive him. Police suspect the 46-year-old patient committed suicide. A case of unnatural death was registered and the body sent for autopsy. The patient from Narkeldanga was detected HIV-positive a couple of years ago. For the past eight months, he was undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) at Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But because of his irregular visits to the hospital for the therapy, his CD4 count dropped drastically following which he was rushed to the medical college last month. The man was taken home after he became stable and admitted to STM two weeks back since he had become anaemic and was suffering from bouts of diarrhoea. The victim's family members said that he would often skip medicines and needed constant monitoring. His son was hence staying with him so that he could be looked after properly. According to the patient's son, he had fed him and given him all necessary medicines before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept thereafter. At 4.30am, he was woken up by a groaning sound and found his father lying on the floor with blood all around. His abdomen was split open and the intestines visible. A knife brought by the son to cut fruits was used to cut open the abdomen, said police. \"Though the doctors attended to him immediately, the patient couldn't be revived as he had lost a lot of blood and the injury was grievous. He succumbed to the injury an hour later,\" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal. The patient was depressed and suffering from dementia, said doctors. Police believe he was unable to bear the sufferings and hence killed himself. \"The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted. We can confirm if it was suicide or homicide once we get the autopsy report,\" said a senior police officer of the detective department. A 46-year-old patient was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his hospital cabin in School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Thursday morning. Though it is suspected as a case of suicide, police has registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body for post mortem. The HIV positive patient from Narkeldanga was getting treatment for a cabin at STM. His son too stayed with him at the same cabin to look after him. On hearing someone groaning in pain at the wee hours the son woke up to find his father lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He alerted the nurses on duty who called in the medical officer. Despite giving all emergency medical attention, the man succumbed to the injury. According to the son, he has fed his father and given all medications before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept after that. Around 4.30 am he was awakened by the sound of groaning. He woke up to find his father on the floor will blood all around. To the shock of the doctors who rushed in they found the abdomen of the patient slit deep and wide and his intestine had popped out. \"He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,\" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal. The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea. Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week. A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient. Police suspects that he was unable to bear with sufferings and hence took his own life. \"The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted and hence it looks like a case of suicide. However whether it was suicide or homicide will be confirmed once we get the autopsy report,\" said a senior police officer of the detective department."

        "title": "Malnutrition behind 55% of TB cases in India, not HIV",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: The search for a tuberculosis vaccine has proved elusive despite decades of research. However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut TB disease incidence in India by half \u2014 food. Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study. In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, malnutrition, poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB. Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. \"Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,\" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment. Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST\u2014Directly Observed and Supported Treatment \u2013 which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment. He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition. An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. \"TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,\" said Gupta. \"It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,\" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care."

One of these women said, \u201cThere are care homes for women, destitute children and elderly but there is no care home for single women living with HIV. We demand a care home for such women.\u201d She added that the government should construct a care home under the social security schemes on priority basis.

I am now living with my mother but I do not have any financial security now,\u201d said one of the women gathered at Statue Circle. Sushila Mordiya, founder director, Positive Women Network of Rajasthan, said after being tested positive for HIV women\u2019s lives become a challenge as it is a social taboo too. \u201cHIV jeopardizes their life not only socially but also financially. There are incidents when a woman faces discrimination in her own house. So, such people need proper care for their rehabilitation,\u201d said Mordiya. They also demanded that there should be free journey for them in Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation as they need to travel frequently for medicines and treatment. These women also said that since under Right to Education Act there is a provision for admission of students from poor background in private schools in Class I, there should be also be provision for the admission of their children in other classes too as per educational qualification. They also claimed that the HIV positive children should be given free higher education. All these women held a meeting at Statue Circle and demanded that their rehabilitation should be done properly."

        "body": "HOUSTON: Scientists have for the first time grown vaginal skin cells outside the body to better identify the good bacteria that protect women from HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and the Oak Crest Institute of Science in Pasadena, California, set out to study the relationship between the skin cells and the \"good\" bacteria. The health of the human vagina depends on a symbiotic/mutually beneficial relationship with \"good\" bacteria that live on its surface feeding on products produced by vaginal skin cells. These good bacteria, in turn, create a physical and chemical barrier to bad bacteria and viruses including HIV. The researchers are the first to grow human vaginal skin cells in a dish in a manner that creates surfaces that support colonisation by the complex good and bad communities of bacteria collected from women during routine gynecological exams. The bacteria communities have never before been successfully grown outside a human. By using this model of the human vagina, researchers discovered that certain bacterial communities alter the way HIV infects and replicates. Their laboratory model will allow careful and controlled evaluation of the complex community of bacteria to ultimately identify those species that weaken the defenses against HIV. The research group led by Richard Pyles at UTMB also indicated that this model \"will provide the opportunity to study the way that these mixed species bacterial communities change the activity of vaginal applicants including over-the-counter products like douches and prescription medications and contraceptives.\" The team documented the potential for their system to better evaluate current and future antimicrobial drugs in terms of how they interact with \"good and bad\" bacteria. In their current studies a bacterial community associated with a symptomatic condition called bacterial vaginosis substantially reduced the antiviral activity of one of the leading anti-HIV medicines. Conversely, vaginal surfaces occupied by healthy bacteria and treated with the antiviral produced significantly less HIV than those vaginal surfaces without bacteria treated with the same antiviral. The study was published in the journal PLOS One."

According to the Global Tuberculosis (TB) Re port-2016, India accounts for 24% of global TB cases. Six countries -India, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa -account for 60% of the global total. India is also the hub for multi-drug resistant TB. India is under international pressure to tackle the national pressure to tackle the TB problem on priority , as it accounts for 1,400 of the 5,000 TB deaths daily worldwide. Though the number of deaths from the disease has come down in the past few years globally as well as in India, but with a huge rural population living with poor sanitation and poor nutrition, elimination of the disease in India looks like a distant dream. The HIV and malaria burden is also significantly high in India. In 2015, the number of people living with HIV in India was estimated at 21.17 lakh, whereas 86,000 new HIV cases were found. India also accounts for the highest malaria burden outside Africa. Around 7.5 lakh cases and 188 malaria deaths were recorded till September 2016.

As the new academic and financial years begin, they take orders to make stationary for offices. Throughout the year, these engage themselves in various activities to earn their living. Many of them support their families too. The centre has trained 56 HIV positive women in various skills. Many of them completed their education from the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University.

        "body": "WASHINGTON: HIV in suicide mode! In a breakthrough, researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have created a microbicide that can trick HIV into killing itself without disturbing any healthy cells. Pinning down an effective way to combat the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, the viral precursor to AIDS, has long been a challenge for scientists and physicians, because the virus is an elusive one that mutates frequently and, as a result, quickly becomes immune to medication. A team of Drexel University researchers is trying to get one step ahead of the virus with a microbicide they've created that can trick HIV into \"popping\" itself into oblivion. The microbicide DAVEI - which stands for \"Dual Action Virolytic Entry Inhibitor\" - is the latest in a new generation of HIV treatments that function by specifically destroying the virus without harming healthy cells, researchers said. \"While several molecules that destroy HIV have recently been announced, DAVEI is unique among them by virtue of its design, specificity and high potency,\" said Dr Cameron Abrams, a professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and a primary investigator of the project. A team co-led by Abrams and Dr Irwin Chaiken in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Drexel's College of Medicine, and including R V Kalyana Sundaram, developed the chimeric recombinantly engineered protein - that is, a molecule assembled from pieces of other molecules and engineered for a specific purpose, in this case to fight HIV. HIV invades a healthy cell by first attaching via protein \"spikes\" that then collapse to pull viral and cell membranes together, fusing them and allowing the genetic contents of the virus to enter the healthy cell. The cell is rewired by the viral genetic material into producing more viruses instead of performing its normal function, which, in the case of cells infected by HIV, involves normal immunity. AIDS is the result. \"We hypothesised that an important role of the fusion machinery is to open the viral membrane when triggered, and it follows that a trigger didn't necessarily have to be a doomed cell,\" Abrams said. \"So we envisioned particular ways the components of the viral fusion machinery work and designed a molecule that would trigger it prematurely,\" Abrams said. The team designed DAVEI from two main ingredients. One piece, called the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), is itself a small piece of the fusion machinery and interacts strongly with viral membranes. The other piece, called cyanovirin, binds to the sugar coating of the protein spike. Working together, the MPER and cyanovirin in DAVEI \"tweak\" the fusion machinery in a way that mimics the forces it feels when attached to a cell. The study was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy."

Meanwhile, it is facing financial constraints as well. USACS officials say they had been informed by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) that a consignment of over 3 lakh condoms was on its way over a month back, but they haven\u2019t received it yet. With no condoms to distribute, officials are concerned that important birth control and AIDS prevention programmes are being affected in the state. \u201cWe were running out of the stock. If the situation remains the same for the next few months, it will be difficult for us to distribute free condoms to the targeted population,\u201d said Rajendra Pandey, additional project director at USACS, talking to TOI. Uttarakhand has 6,556 female sex workers and 1,795 MSM. According to department sources, the state needs over 14 lakh condoms in a year. USACS sends a population-based demand estimate for contraceptives twice a year. The existing stock, however, will run out by the end of this month. The Target Intervention (TI) programme, which mainly focuses on MSM, female sex workers, truck drivers and migrants, gets the largest share of the total stock received. The department also supplies free condoms to NGOs working closely with HIV-positive and vulnerable people. Apart from this, shortage of funds is also giving sleepless nights to the officials. \u201cWe are not able to give salaries to our employees and our associated NGOs are yet to be paid.

She\u2019s been bringing odds and ends from home to the summer workshop for teachers at Shaheed Amir Chand Government Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, near Kashmere Gate, daily -- used soft-drink bottles, batteries, bits of insulated wire, empty tablet blister packs and a drawer-slide.Science teachers have use for everything. Safety-pins are especially valuable. Kaur already uses much of the rubbish she collects in class but for the drawer-slide, a few more put their heads together. They devised a rudimentary scale to explain spring action using the slide, a rubber band, strip of paper and safety-pin. Delhi Government has organised the summer workshops to help teachers do just this sort of thing more often -- create support material and teaching aids independently, with bits and bobs teachers and students can get their hands on easily. This is part of the government's efforts to improving learning. \u201cWe generally use waste material. These activities can help explain things in the classroom without having to run to the laboratory,\u201d said Kiran Tokas, a guest teacher now serving as mentor teacher. Social science teachers are using the game of Chinese whispers to impress upon children the problems of historiography.Throught the summer, the 200 mentor teachers will serve as \u201cfacilitators\u201d for roughly 24,000 government school trained graduate teachers (TGTs). In batches of about 40 -- two \u2018facilitators\u2019 to a batch -- seven rounds of workshops of four days each will be conducted at nine venues. At Amir Chand SKV, 617 science and social science teachers -- 15 batches -- completed the workshop on Thursday and were even paid a visit by the eudcation minister, Manish Sisodia.Each batch will cover a part of the syllabus, contributing toward a common repertory of lesson plans, activities and support material designs that can be replicated by others.Replication, however, is easier discussed at workshops than done. The science teachers of SKV Kakrola put together a lesson-plan involving cotton-balls, two sheep characters (Baby Dolly and Mama Dolly), some knitting and weaving to transact the lesson on \u201cfibre to fabric\u201d. But they themselves concede that must of these activities demand far smaller class-sizes than what they deal with.

The average class-size for teachers here is over 60,\u201d observe Neeru Behl, from a SKV in Janakpuri. The teachers still try, through group activity and student leaders.This isn\u2019t the first workshop -- seminars and trainings are routine -- but the first where it\u2019s okay to hop across to check what another group\u2019s doing with its safety-pins. The standard-issue seminars repeat resource persons and are in \u201clecture-mode\u201d -- what the workshops are trying to get teachers to break out of."

        "body": "Panaji: Knowledge about the effectiveness of contraceptives in reducing chances of being afflicted with HIV/AIDS is high among Goa\u2019s adolescent population, but comprehensive knowledge of the dreaded diseases is poor, says a report of national family health survey (NFHS) \u2013 2015-16. The findings of the survey released with the economic survey 2015-16 indicates that men who are aware that consistent use of condom can prevent HIV/AIDs is as high as 91.9% in urban areas and 84.7% in rural areas, and 89.2% overall. The awareness has in fact risen significantly from 56.8% as reported in the NFHS-3 survey of 2005-06 to 89.2% in 2015-16. In the case of women, the awareness about the use of contraceptives in reducing chances of HIV/AIDS is 80.8% among urban females and 71.7% among their rural counterparts, the overall percentage being 77.4%, the report states. As per NFHS-3 in 2005-06, the percentage of awareness about the condom use was low at 47.6% as compared to 77.4% in 2015-16. But the survey states that men who have comprehensive knowledge of AIDS/HIV comprise only 42.9% in urban areas and 40.4% in rural areas, with 41.9% being the overall percentage. In 2005-06, the percentage of awareness among males was 30.3. In the case of women, those with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS comprise just 36.0% in urban areas and 32.2% in rural areas, the overall figure being 34.6%. In comparison, the awareness about this aspect among females was just 28.5% in 2005-06, the survey states. But health officials point out that while the awareness about usefulness of condoms in AIDS control is high, it appears contradictory that their knowledge about the dreaded disease is variably low. This may be due to the small sample size of the NFHS survey, sources said. \u201cThe awareness about this particular aspect should be higher,\u201d project director, Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Jose de Sa said."

        "body": "KOLHAPUR: The number of deaths due to HIV infection in Kolhapur has remained more or less the same over the past seven years. A recent report revealed that as many as 2,436 persons, including some children, have died due to HIV in the district since 2007. The report was prepared by the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit and included the figures till October end for the current year. Of the total deaths, 60% were men and 36% are women. Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of DAPCU, said, \u201cIn some cases, the HIV positive men do not even disclose their infection to their wives. There have been cases in which the family found out about the infection when the health condition of the patient turned critical. Such tendency jeopardizes the health and future of the entire family. It is also an important season behind high mortality due to HIV infection.\u201d Kolhapur was among the six high HIV prevalence districts in the state. The high prevalence can be attributed to the presence of a large number of migrant labourers. Unprotected sexual activity and in some cases, having sex with multiple partners are two major reasons behind transmission of the infection, health officials said. Jagdish Patil, regional programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, said, \u201cKolhapur district has 3-4 major industrial areas along with textile business of Ichalkaranji. These industrial enterprises are major job creators and people from at least 100-km periphery migrate to Kolhapur in search of jobs. A significant number of labourers are HIV positive.\u201d Another category, which is unique to Kolhapur district, is the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters from Marathwada, north Maharashtra and Karnataka between October and April. The National AIDS Control Organization had conducted a pilot project in Kolhapur district in 2013-14 to find out prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases among the sugarcane cutters. At least one lakh people migrate to Kolhapur during the sugarcane cutting season, and most of them are men who travel in groups. The report has already pointed out that unconventional working hours, heavy load and liquor consumption activities among the sugarcane cutters make them vulnerable. Patil pointed out that during their pilot project the people living with HIV admitted that they were involved in unprotected sexual activity. These activities are still prevalent and highly challenging to keep a control over. Kimaya Shah, managing trustee of city-based Lotus Foundation, is involved in conducting various awareness, support and medication activities in the district. \u201cThere is still stigma associated with the infection. It restricts acceptance of the disease due to which many people neglect regular medication and fail to keep the infection under control.\u201d"

The 31-year-old culprit is a resident of Mirjalguda in Malkajgiri. According to police, the auto driver had married thrice and all his wives deserted him due to his wayward habits. Merwya Carl, a software engineer from Seven Hills Colony in Uppal, lodged a complaint with the Uppal police on October 17 alleging that burglars stole five-tola gold jewellery from his house. On August 5, 2015, Carl and his wife left the city on some personal work and they realized about the burglary after returning home on October 17. While leaving the house, Carl gave keys of his house to a group of friends with whom he parties at home when the family members were away. The auto driver is also part of the group. Police summoned all the friends of Carl for questioning. During interrogation, the auto driver confessed to have committed the offence. Police recovered the stolen booty of five-tola gold from his possession. When police grilled him about the other crimes committed by him, he informed them about gambling cases booked against him at the Lalaguda and Malkajgiri police stations. \"He also confessed that he has been suffering from HIV disease, which he came to know about several months ago. The auto driver also claimed he visits prostitutes daily and has illicit affairs with several other women, with whom he practiced unsafe sex even after realizing about his disease,\" Uppal inspector (Detective) Khaja Moinuddin said. The culprit told police that after realizing about his disease, he had unprotected sex with over 300 women, including some housewives, whom he came in contact while taking their children to school in his auto. The culprit was remanded in judicial custody. The Uppal police also caught a 22-year-old thief, G Mahesh, during vehicle check at Ramanthapur on Tuesday while he was travelling on a stolen bike. Based on his confession, police recovered 11 stolen bikes from his possession. The culprit committed the offences in the past year at Uppal and Nacharam areas."

Health and family welfare minister UT Khader said: \"We want Karnataka to be No. 1 in the country in eradicating the disease. The forum will be effectively implemented only if all legislators and representatives work together.\" Why was the HIV/AIDS forum formed? People's representatives at the grassroots level play an important role in eradicating the disease. The forum was formed to support and implement the directives of the Parliamentarians Forum on HIV/AIDS effectively. Who are the members of the forum? The forum consists of 30 members, 20 MLAs and 10 MLCs. The suggestions of former health ministers and doctors will also be taken. What is the role and responsibility of the members? There are nearly 2.5 lakh people in the state who are affected by HIV/AIDS. The forum will enable all central government programmes to be implemented effectively. The members will reach out to gram panchayat and gram sabha members. All of them will put in their best efforts to create awareness in their respective constituencies. Belgaum, Bagalkot and Bijapur districts are considered a high-risk zone for HIV/AIDS. Any special measures for these districts? It's turned into a high-risk zone due to backwardness and poor standard of living and awareness. The other reason is migration of people from Maharashtra and Goa. We'll focus more on these high-risk zones."

But she was asked to quit after people at her workplace learnt about her HIV-positive status six months ago. \"Suddenly people started feeling uncomfortable around me. I was asked to quit,\" she says. Experiences of people like Sreelatha will go into the making of a stigma index' which Tamil Nadu hopes to use for fighting discrimination. The state, which has 1.5 lakh people living with HIV, will be the first in the country to have such an index. HIV positive people will interview victims of stigma so that they open up and discuss their experiences. The accounts of thousands of such people would go into developing the index which will eventually reflect the levels and spread of discrimination. \"The research outcome would help the government and communities strategise programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination,\" said Vishwanath Koliwad, secretary veneral of the Family Planning Association of India, the implementing agency. The project launched on Friday is funded by the Department for International Development. The family planning body and some other designated organisations would set up a Project Advisory Committee to set goals and review the progress of the project. The index was launched in the Dominican Republic in 2008 and followed up by twelve other countries the next year. It documents and compares different experiences of people living with HIV in different countries, measures changes over a period of time, and creates an evidence base and possible solutions. \"It aims to address key barriers to HIV treatment, prevention, care and support. We also hope to collect information and experiences of people living with HIV-related discrimination and human rights,\" said project coordinator Anandi Yuvaraj The index would also help people suffering from HIV/AIDS to know more about their rights and improve their situation. \"We have found that stigma is increasing in areas where intervention is less,\" said AIDS Prevention and Control project director Dr Bimal Charles. A pilot survey done among 64 people in five countries found that 64% of them suffered harassment or assault and most of the cases were as a result of their HIV status. About 35% reported losing their jobs because of their HIV status."

        "body": "KOLKATA: An HIV explosion might be waiting to happen in Kolkata. One per cent of the city's 15,000 street children (in the age group of 5-14) are HIV-positive, but were not aware of the fact that they were carrying the deadly virus, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata. Most victims did not even know how the disease got transmitted or its symptoms and had contracted the lethal virus through sexual abuse, says the survey. While around 4% suffered from other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, nearly 10% of these youngsters faced sexual abuse before turning 16. Titled Non-tobacco Substance Use, Sexual Abuse, HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Street Children in Kolkata', the study was carried out across 58 municipal wards of the city. More than 550 street children, who have no family, were interviewed and observed from 2007 to 2009. Random blood samples were collected to check the prevalence of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted diseases. The results have left the team of researchers shocked. \"One per cent of these children were HIV-positive which is a big number. Being marginalised and without any access to medical care, they will probably never come to know of their HIV status. Or, by the time they do, they will have infected others. This is an alarming situation since the urban homeless often act as a bridge between the infected population and those who are at risk. We need immediate intervention to check a potential epidemic,\" said Kamalesh Sarkar, deputy director, division of epidemiology, NICED. Sarkar led a five-member research team for the study. While no specific age of the HIV victims could be established from the random survey, all were below 16 years. Inquiring into the reasons behind the spread of the virus, the researchers found that most had faced sexual abuse. \"A minor percentage might have got the virus from sex workers. It is quite possible that they passed it on to others since both sexual abuse and promiscuity was common among street children. It is unlikely that any had got the virus from their parents,\" said Sarkar. The study reveals that while 26% of male street children faced sexual abuse before they turned 15, 13% of the girls who faced abuse were above 15 years. Around 13% of the boys who visited sex workers suffered from sexually transmitted diseases. \"Without any shelter or protection, these children will continue to be vulnerable. Moreover, they had no idea of HIV or that they could end up carrying the virus and infect others. Since there has never been any such study in the past, it is difficult to say if the number is rising. But unless steps are taken, it will definitely spiral and pose a serious health hazard which we are probably not ready to deal with,\" said Baishali Bal, one of the researchers. Less than half of the street children got two square meals a day, more than 85% slept in public places and earned less than Rs 1,000 a month. Substance abuse, the study disclosed, was extremely high among them. Thirty per cent used non-tobacco substances like adhesives, brown sugar, cocaine and alcohol. NICED has proposed shelters and support centres for street children at railway stations. \"It is at places like stations and markets that they generally tend to camp in search of work and food. We have written to the railway ministry to join hands with us for shelters at the stations,\" said Sarkar."

        "body": "PATNA: A National Aids Control Organistion (NACO) ad has caught attention of many: A five-year-old's HIV positive mom is lying unattended at a hospital. The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice. Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain. Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated. It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. \"However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,\" he said. As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead \"referred to PMCH/IGIMS.\" To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. \"The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,\" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time. In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. \"I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?\" Kumar asked TOI on Friday. The doctors Kumar visited have written \"HIV+\" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS. Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case. He has made several rounds of the PMCH's Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology since then. Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi). Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said. According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. \"Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,\" Ranjan said. \"After the death of a woman last year, the PMCH administration promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV. That promise has gone in vain. Doctors say they are not being provided safety kits while their hospitals deny this claim. The responsibility has not been fixed and, as such, the vicious cycle of denial goes on,\" Ranjan said. (Patients' names have been changed)"

This is a golden opportunity for them to get to know everything about the disease. \"After coming here, I realized I was quite ignorant about several facts regarding HIV/AIDS and its precautionary measures. I used to feel shy about asking my elders or friends about the disease. But now all my doubts have been cleared,\" said Subha Pangi of Pottangi. The six-coach multimedia, multi-facility train has arrangements for pictorial, audio-visual, graphic and even telephonic presentation on HIV/AIDS. It drew a large crowd from the tribal district on the very first day of its arrival. Koraput is the train's first stop in the state, and it will stay here till Thursday. tnnVolunteers from several social organizations gathered here to know more about the deadly disease. \"The RRE has proved to be beneficial for the tribals of the district, who are mostly illiterate and ignorant about the disease. Most of the rural folk are in the dark about this deadly disease and fall prey to it unknowingly. This was a good experience for them,\" said a local social activist, K Rama Rao. The RRE, which was flagged off in the second week of January from New Delhi as a part of a HIV/ AIDS awareness campaign, will camp at Balangir, Bargarh, Samablpur, Angul, Cuttack and Ganjam before reching Bhubaneswar on July 10. While the first coach displays bio-medical aspects of the disease, counselling-cum-medical services are available in the last coach. Three other coaches are dedicated to exhibitions on the disease. A fourth coach exhibits details on tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive and child health services, general health and hygiene. Going beyond the usual posters and pictures, the coaches have touch screens and 3-D models to disseminate information. Prior to the inauguration of the RRE at the Koraput railway station by collector Koraput Sachin Jadhav, an awareness rally against the disease was organized in the town."

Around 40% of HIV positive people don\u2019t know their HIV status and are hidden in the community, either due to ignorance or the stigma associated with it. \u201cEarlier people would be hesitant to get themselves tested because they thought there was no hope. Now they know there\u2019s treatment available and there\u2019s some light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d the official said, adding that only once the stigma goes away will more people step forward to get themselves tested. Thanks to the test-and-treat policy rolled out by the government in April this year, those who have tested positive for HIV can avail free antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the past, the therapy was provided only when a person\u2019s CD4 count went below normal and if it was clinically felt that his resistance had gone down. \u201cNow every person who tests positive can be put on treatment, ensuring that his viral load is kept low, thereby preventing him from contracting AIDS early on,\u201d he said, citing examples of people who have lived up to 25 years after being tested HIV+."

MSM (men who have sex with men), FSW (female sex worker), drug users, transgender and migrants are high-risk persons and our efforts will focus on them.\" \"HIV-affected children were given financial aid up to Rs 700 per month. In the district, 50% of the population affected with HIV were given bus passes for private buses. Under the DC Special Fund, 249 HIV affected children were given nutritous food, hygiene kits and housing. Udupi is considered a model by other districts,\" he added. The ART centres in the district are giving free treatment and medicines to HIV patients. From 2008 till October 2016, pre-ART registration at Udupi was 3,968 members and there were 727 deaths. In Kundapur, the registration was 957 and total number of deaths was 21."

On World HIV AIDS Day, people, especially women afflicted with HIV, shared how the disease completely changed their lives. But in the end, they have all decided to fight it instead of giving up. \"My children do not know that I am a sex worker. I earn Rs 15,000 a month and raise my children. I take medicines which ensure the virus remains under control,\u201d says Rita. Shyama is made of sterner stuff. She was 23-year-old when she was detected with HIV. Her husband kicked her out of their home. Two years later, when the husband was diagnosed with HIV and his parents abandoned him, Shyama opened her house for him. \u201cI could feel the pain of being discriminated just because you have a disease,\u201d says Shyama who also has a 12-year-old daughter.

Dr US Sooch, district programme officer of HIV-AIDS prevention, said: \u201cImparting awareness to mothers to openly discuss their problems with doctors is helping a lot. As such mothers are motivated, they take medicines regularly, and the fixed dose is continued for a lifetime. When a baby is six weeks old, an HIV test is done. If it turns out to be negative, then the test is done again at six months, and again at 18 months if it is negative. If even after 18 months, the test comes out negative again, then the child is declared HIV-free. Now, if the test turns out positive in six weeks, then the medicine (single dose) is started, and after the HIV test at six months, if it is positive again, then a final test is done at 18 months, and if it is positive again, then the medicine is given for a lifetime.\u201d Sooch further said that earlier, HIV positive women and children were given a single dose at the time of delivery. But now, the treatment is started in pregnancy itself, if the woman is declared HIV-positive, and the medicine for a pregnant mother is a fixed dose combination, but for a child, the single dose continues as earlier. So, less than 5% cases of transfer of disease from mother to child are found, whereas the rest 95% newborn are all safe. CURRENT TREATMENT Treatment during pregnancy: One tablet \u2014 a combination of three ARV (anti-retro viral) medicines \u2014 is given to a pregnant mother at night after meal. Treatment for HIV-positive mother is life-long. Test done for child/newborn: First at six weeks, then at six months, and then at 18 months. The medicine, however, is started right from birth itself. Fall in number of cases: With this new fixed doze combination of medicines, chances of an HIV-positive child being born has come down from 10-20% to less than 5% where mothers took the treatment."

The next month, he will take part in the 4th Mr World Championship in Bangkok. A resident of Khamnam Leirak in Imphal West, Pradip (43) disclosed his health status to the media a few days after bagging the 60-kg category senior 'Mr Manipur' title in a state-level competition held here in December, 2007. Pradip, a brand ambassador of Manipur Aids Control Society (Macs), later bagged silver and bronze medals in different national competitions and stood eighth in the 'Mr World' competition. Manipur is one of the six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states of the country. According to Macs, the state has 38,016 people infected with HIV, including 10,109 women and 2,578 children. Pradip, who has emerged as an icon of inspiration to the world, spends around Rs 40,000 in procuring foreign nutritional diet every month. \"Macs, which used to pay Rs 8,000 a month for my nutritional support, has stopped extending the amount since June this year,\" Pradip informed TOI on Monday. \"The state government which had promised to appoint me as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department in 2009 also failed to do anything about it. This was another major setback,\" said Pradip. A group of HIV positive widows of the state launched a charity campaign to collect money for him after they came to know about his financial condition. They are providing me monetary help and I am very thankful to them, he said. Recently, a social organization donated Rs 1.5 lakh to the bodybuilder for his cause, he said. \"Since I do not have money, I am not in a position to procure the standard nutritional diet. But I am ready to fight all odds and I will manage to make it through. I will continue with my rigorous practice and give my best at both the competitions,\" he added."

If a pregnant woman tested positive, we try to reduce the chance of transmission of HIV to her child by up to 4%.\" \"Awareness among pediatricians about mother-to-child HIV transmission needs to increase.

But patients on antiretroviral therapy who stop taking the drugs suffer a rapid rebound in HIV replication,\u201c said Kamel Khalili, from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in US. The presence of numerous copies of HIV weakens the immune system and eventually causes AIDS. Eliminating the HIV virus after it has become integrated into CD4+ T-cells, the cells primarily infected with the virus, has proven difficult. Recent attempts have focused on intentionally reactivating HIV, aiming to stimulate a robust immune response capable of eradicating the virus. However, none of these \u201cshock and kill\u201c approaches has been successful. Researchers targeted HIV-1 proviral DNA (the integrated viral genome) using uniquely tailored gene editing technology. Their system includes a guide RNA that specifically loca tes HIV-1 DNA in the T-cell genome, and a nuclease enzyme, which cuts the strands of T-cell DNA. Once the nuclease has edited out the HIV-1 DNA sequence, the loose ends of the genome are reunited by the cell's own DNA repair machinery . Researchers focused on infected CD4+ T cells to show that the technology eliminates the virus from cells and also its persistent presence in HIV-1-eradicated cells protects them against reinfection. The researchers carried their work over to ex vivo experiments, in which T-cells from patients infected with HIV were grown in cell culture, showing that treatment with the gene editing system can suppress viral replication and reduce viral load in patient cells."

The lawyer submitted that the patients infected with HIV are given a band to be tied on their heads so that others could identify them and keep distance from them. He also produced photographs of patients carrying tags of HIV on their heads. The petition claims that such a branding of HIV infected people is inhuman treatment to them, for this marking leads to isolation of these patients as other patients and their relatives maintain a \"safe distance\" from them. The petitioner also pointed out that this inhuman practice also causes panic among other patients who are in the hospital. The PIL cited a guideline given by the Supreme Court saying that the identity of such people must not be disclosed. The lawyer also cited rules framed by the Medical Council of India in this regard. The PIL has demanded immediate restriction on this practice of disclosing AIDS patients' identity. It has also sought action against responsible officials. After hearing the case, a bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala sought reply from the state health department secretary, Jamnagar collector and the medical superintendent of the GG Hospital. Further hearing on this issue is kept next week. Meanwhile, other PILs are also being heard by the HC on the issue of HIV infected people.

Researchers have found that Treg cells, a type of regulatory lymphocyte, might be protecting babies in the womb from getting infected with the HIV virus when the mother is infected. \"Finding out what protects the majority of babies is important, as it can lead to ways to boost natural immune responses and make individuals resistant to HIV infection,\" said researcher Peter Kessler from the Emory University School of Medicine. Scientists had been puzzled for years by the fact that only a minority of babies born to mothers with HIV infection get the infection from their mothers. Currently, HIV infection can be successfully managed with antiretroviral drugs, but these drugs have to be given for life. Preventing the infection is very important, but there is no vaccine available yet. Researchers found that levels of Treg lymphocytes were higher in the blood of newborn babies born to mothers with HIV infection who had escaped the infection themselves, compared with babies who were born with HIV infection. Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses. Treg cells, or regulatory T cells, are an important \"self-check\" in the immune system to prevent excessive immune reactions that could lead to tissue damage. The researchers examined the blood of 64 babies who were born HIV-uninfected and 28 babies born HIV-infected and found that Treg cell levels were higher in uninfected babies at the time of birth. In contrast, other lymphocyte types were activated and higher in HIV-infected infants. The HIV virus can only infect cells that are activated, so Treg may protect from HIV infection by suppressing activation of other lymphocytes. They analyzed the stored blood by flow cytometry, a technique that can differentiate between the different types of cells based on what markers they express on their surface. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express the markers CD4, CD25, and FOXP3. \"Even though the number of babies studied is relatively small, these findings indicate that Treg, by controlling immune activation, may lower the vulnerability of the babies to HIV or other chronic infections even before they are born,\" said Kessler. These results could pave the way for the development of vaccines or other immune-based therapies that could be used together with medications to prevent the spread of HIV or other infections from mothers to their babies."

        "body": "Hyderabad: There is further trouble brewing for Telangana State AIDS Control Society (TSACS) with several of their partner community-based organisations and NGOs saying that they could never reach their targets for the year. The NGOs work with vulnerable communities like lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT), female sex workers (FSWs) and male sex workers (MSWs). With Rs 40 crore arrears remaining unpaid by TSACS in the last two years despite National AIDS Control Society (NACO) releasing adequate funds, the CBOs and NGOs said they do not have adequate funds. The latest to issue a termination notice is city-based CBO Suraksha Society, which is running two projects in partnership with TSACS with a target population of 3,000 FSWs and MSWs in Hyderabad and Saidabad respectively. \u201cWe request you to kindly consider accepting our withdrawal of partnership with TSACS for two of our projects with effect from Thursday (December, 29),\u201d the office bearers of Suraksha Society wrote in a termination notice letter (copy with TOI) submitted to the office of project director, TSACS, on Tuesday. The reasons listed for severing their ties include fund crisis in TSACS and no assurance for the pending arrears of 12 months among several other grievances. \u201cWith our 12-month dues worth Rs 36 lakhs for our two projects yet to be cleared by TSACS, we have reached such a situation that some of our peer educators from FSWs and MSWs on a monthly salary of Rs 3,300 now abuse us using vulgar language for non-payment of their salaries,\u201d said G Krishna, project director, Suraksha Society. Unable to survive, many of these peer educators, who were once active members belonging to LGBT, FSWs or MSWs, are said to be going back to their old profession. There are around 52,000 LGBT members in the city as per a survey done by an international NGO in 2000. \u201cThe TSACS has asked us to cut down our existing staff to half when in reality, they need to rope in more CBOs for HIV counseling, testing, medical check-ups and for spreading awareness among vulnerable sections,\u201d rued G Krishna. Meanwhile, P Karthik, project director of Darpan Foundation, which works with MSWs, said that they are coordinating with all the existing 15 partner NGOs and 3 CBOs in the city to discuss future course of action on their arrears. \u201cWhile two CBOs have issued termination notices to TSACS already, including Suraksha Society and Chaithanya Mahila Mandali, other partner organisations will take a take a decision in a meeting scheduled next week,\u201d said Karthik. He said that their own dues of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh are still pending clearance."

        "body": "JAIPUR: The theme for this year\u2019s World AIDS Day is \u2018Getting to Zero\u2019, which is a challenging goal to achieve in a set deadline since a lot of pregnant women go untested for HIV and there is a high risk of vertical transmission of virus. The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is taking measures to increase the number of tests for HIV among pregnant women. There are 20% home births where they don\u2019t lend an ear to the need of getting tested for HIV. According to health department officials, the institutional deliveries have increased significantly up to 80% but still 20% remain home-based deliveries. An RSACS official said, \u201cIn institutional deliveries, the chances of HIV transmission from mother to child reduces to 2-3% if universal precaution of delivery and proper medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV are taken. Also, such mothers should not breastfeed their babies.\u201d There are 18 lakh pregnancies reported every year in the state. In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent. Among them, 412 were tested positive for HIV and there was a risk of transmission from mother to child. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86 lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. Three years have passed but a 25-year-old Usha\u2019s (name changed) tears still trickle down when she remembers the moment her newly born baby was declared tested positive for HIV. She was a resident of Jharkhand before she was married to a resident of the city. \u201cI came to know that I am HIV positive at the time of my son\u2019s birth. He was born in a government hospital in Jaipur three years ago. When doctors tested him for HIV, they informed me that he is born with HIV infection. Now, like me, he is also taking medicines for the infection,\u201d said Usha on the eve of World AIDS Day. She added that she could not even breastfed her baby like other mothers as doctors had asked her not to do so. Usha\u2019s case highlights vertical transmission of HIV from mother to baby at a time when there are medicines available which could reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to baby during child birth. Besides, Sunita (name changed), a 35-year-old woman living with HIV also narrated the same story. She said that her first child, a girl is HIV positive and she came to know that her husband and she \u2013 both were HIV positive during their first child birth. \u201cMy five-year-old daughter is HIV positive like my husband and me. But, I am happy for my son as he does not have this disease. The doctors had him tested for HIV after his birth but he is HIV negative because I took some medicines to prevent the vertical transmission,\u201d said Sunita, who is one of those HIV positive women, who had gathered at Statue Circle in Jaipur on the eve of World AIDS Day."

        "body": "CHENNAI: More than two years after the foundation stone was laid, the city's first post-graduate nursing institute dedicated to treating HIV+ patients in Tambaram remains a non-starter due to shortage of funds. On November 1, 2008, the then union minister for health and family welfare, Anbumani Ramdoss, laid the foundation stone for the Rs 28 crore-Indian Institute of Advanced Nursing at Tambaram Sanatorium. Little work has happened since then. \"As many organisations, both public and private, are involved, mobilisation of funds and co-ordination between different organisations have been challenges in executing the project,\" sources in the state health department told The Times Of India. The nursing institute a unique public-private partnership venture with state-of-the-art facilities was dedicated to train nurses providing healthcare to HIV+ve patients in the country. A joint venture of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), Indian Nursing Council, William J Clinton Foundation and Yale University, the institute was slated to come up on a five-acre plot near the National Institute of Siddha at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM). The idea to set up such an institute, according to sources, was that the GHTM is not only a centre of excellence for treating HIV+ve persons in the country but is also the largest hospital in giving treatment for these patients in the country. At present, the hospital gives treatment for around 4,000 HIV+ve persons. \"The institute was also aimed to act as a national hub for nursing, research and training in HIV/AIDS-related cases,\" sources added. As per plan, the union health ministry has given Rs 5 crore as seed money for the Rs 28-crore project. The Clinton Foundation is responsible for raising the rest of the funds, and Yale University will provide expertise in training. On its part, the state government through TANSACS has given the land for the institute. The feasibility study for the project was done in 2006 by the Union health ministry through NACO. At present, the state has around 10% of the total HIV affected persons in the country and ranks fourth after Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. There is a shortage of 15 lakh nurses in the public health sector in India. During the 11th Plan, the Centre had allotted Rs. 3,900 crore to the nursing sector alone for building human resources, expanding infrastructure and creating four centres of excellence in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkatta. In Tamil Nadu, the state government had granted permission to the private sector for starting 50 nursing schools and colleges."

        "body": "BANGKOK: Thailand has become the first Asian country to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, a milestone in the fight against the disease.The announcement is a boost for a generation of Thai health workers who have transformed the nation from one of Asia's most HIV-ravaged societies to a pin-up for how to effectively tackle the crisis.Describing the elimination as a \"remarkable achievement\", the WHO said Thailand was \"the first (country) with a large HIV epidemic to ensure an AIDS-free generation.\"Belarus and Armenia were also declared free of mother-to-baby HIV transmissions on Wednesday but both nations have a much lower prevalence of the virus.Previously Cuba was the only other country to have eliminated mother-to-child transmission under the WHO's criteria back in July 2015.The global health body said Thailand's routine screening and universal free medication for pregnant women with HIV was crucial in stopping the virus being passed to new generations.If left untreated, mothers with HIV have a 15-45 percent chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, childbirth or while breastfeeding.But taking antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy significantly reduces those chances to just over one percent.In 2000 Thailand became one of the first countries in the world to provide free antiretroviral medication to all pregnant women diagnosed with HIV.Screening for the virus during pregnancy is also routine, even in the country's most remote areas, the WHO added.According to Thai government figures, the number of babies born with HIV has dropped from 1,000 in 2000 to just 85 last year, a large enough fall for the WHO to declare mother-to-child transmission over.A small number of cases are taken into account, as treatment with medicine is not 100 percent effective.It is a major turnaround for Thailand. The country went from 100,000 HIV cases in 1990 to more than a million three years later, fuelled in part by its huge sex trade.Health workers initially struggled to persuade governments to act.But an eventual push to distribute free condoms among sex workers throughout the late 1990s and the widespread rollout of antiretroviral drugs in the 2000s has seen huge success and won the country widespread praise.\"Thailand's progress shows how much can be achieved when science and medicine are underpinned by sustained political commitment,\" UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe said in a statement.But there is still work to be done. The UN estimates there are some 500,000 living with HIV in the kingdom, while infection rates have risen slightly in recent years, particularly among gay men.Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, Thailand's Minister of Public Health, said the landmark announcement \"belongs to everyone\" but added \"a challenge remains: how we make this success sustainable.\"Each year, 1.4 million women living with HIV around the world become pregnant. The number of children born annually with HIV was 400,000 in 2009. By 2013, the number was down to 240,000."

In a new order, the country's top drug regulator said companies manufacturing combination drugs for HIV and Hepatitis B & C can seek early approval with a WHO recommendation, even if internationally the medicines are not approved as a combination but only individually . \u201cMany of these combination products, recommended in WHO guidelines for concomitant use, may not have been approved internationally in combination but may have been approved individually . However, given the risk-benefit and recommendations by WHO, the requirement of generated data may be waived based on the fact that the product has been recommended for concomitant use by WHO,\u201c the notice by G N Singh, the drugs controller general of India said. The move is expected to benefit many of the over 21 lakh people estimated to be living with HIV in India. Moreover, viral hepatitis has also been recognized as a serious public health problem in India by WHO, with a total of over 52 million people infected with chronic hepatitis in the country. The regulator has also allowed leeway to manufacturers to conduct clinical trials or bio-equivalence studies in India. The new norms allow companies to apply for such studies and product approvals simultaneously , whereas usually firms have to submit trial data first. In some cases, the regulator has suggested waiving clinical trials for urgent use. \u201cClinical trial waiver for such products recommended by WHO for concomitant use may be given, as being falling under the category of extreme urgency and under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,\u201c it said. 2% price rise likely for essential medicines. Prices of all essential medicines are likely to go up by nearly 2% from April 1. NPPA has asked companies to submit documents to avail the annual price hike based on wholesale price index (WPI).

A doctor said she was recovering well and responding to the treatment. However, on Thursday night, she developed a problem in her kidneys that resulted in serious respiratory complications, leading to her death.

They took the extreme step on October 24 after their family members decided to throw them away from village. The family members apprehended further spread of the disease if they continued to stay in the locality.

Records from Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at the Vashi civic hospital show that about 400 patients missed the treatment schedule in October. A similar trend was seen in the previous two months as well\u2014 while 380 missed the September treatment, 395 skipped it in August. \u201cThe ART centre provides free medication for 30 days. So, when a patient fails to come to the centre to collect medicines for the next period, they are termed as missing. Ideally, HIV positive patients are not supposed to miss a single dose of medication as it affects their immune system. The medicines suppress the viral load,\u201d said an official from the health centre. A number of patients reportedly miss the treatment because they are unable to travel to the centre. Only 40% are reportedly from the city, while the rest are from far-off places like Panvel and Thane. \u201cA majority are daily-wage earners and find it difficult to travel. Change of job or shifting to a different place are some other reasons,\u201d the official added. Other ART centres are in Raigad areas like Alibaug and Lodhivali. \u201cAs on date, there are 109 patients who have stopped taking medicines from the centre. NGOs are notified about such patients and they try to convince them to get back to the treatment. But many a times, the provided contact details are wrong,\u201d said an official from the health department. Talking about the awareness programme, medical health officer, Dr Ramesh Nikam, said that about 25 street plays highlighting the ways in which HIV spreads and the importance of timely treatment will be organized in high-risk areas. \u201cThe plays will also spread the message of giving moral support to the patients,\u201d he said."

The latter are still treated like pariahs and shown the door even at government hospitals. Last week, a 35-year-old HIV-positive vegetable vendor was turned out of RG Kar Hospital and asked to seek treatment elsewhere. A day earlier, he had been referred to the hospital by Calcutta Medical College, which said it did not have the facilities to treat him. Also suffering from HIV-induced oral cancer, Mohammed Tariq (name changed) is now under treatment at a private hospital where he received his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday, which happened to be World Health Day. Having contracted the deadly virus two years ago, Tariq was under treatment at the School of Tropical Medicine (STM). He was on anti retro-virus therapy drugs supplied by the STM. In January, Tariq developed a cancerous ulcer near the tongue which got infected. Doctors believe it was triggered by the HIV. When he sought treatment for the ulcer at Calcutta Medical College, he was promptly referred to RG Kar Hospital. Last Monday, Tariq went to the emergency department of RG Kar. He says he was shunted around from the oncology department to the surgery section and finally to the hospital's HIV division. \"After two days, I was asked to resume treatment for HIV, even though I had visited the hospital for my mouth ulcer. They said it won't be of any use till my HIV was controlled. When I asked if I could continue treatment at the hospital, they refused and asked me to leave,\" said Tariq, a resident of Rajabazar. In immense pain and barely able to speak, Tariq was taken to a private hospital by neighbours on Wednesday. He received blood transfusion at the hospital and got his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday. Doctors said his oral cancer needs greater attention now, for his HIV is under control. \"HIV might have triggered the oral cancer. Often, it causes lymphoma, oral cancer or cancer in the genitals. But contrary to what he was told at the government hospital, Tariq's ulcer needs to be treated now. It seems he was shooed away due to his HIV status,\" said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, who is treating him. Although his condition was serious, Tariq was still in a state to receive palliative therapy that could keep him reasonably healthy for a few more years, he added. Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. \"With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,\" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law. RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment. \"As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,\" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar. The West Bengal Aids Control and Prevention Society said it was illegal to either refuse treatment or turn away an HIV patient. \"In case we receive a complaint, we shall investigate the matter,\" said Himadri Sekhar Sanyal, the deputy project manager of the society. Mukhopadhyay pointed out that while Tariq needed to carry on his HIV treatment, his oral cancer (buccalmucosa carcinoma) was worsening and might have caused death. \"Without chemotherapy, he wouldn't have survived more than a few months more,\" he said."

Dr Inderjeet Dhingra, who is from Dr DN Kotnis Charitable Trust that had raised the issue and also the programme coordinator of 'Prevention of Parents to Child Transmission Project', said, \"The SMO was equally responsible as such a critical case could not be referred without his permission.

The report was submitted to civil surgeon Dr Renu Chattwal last week and she forwarded it to the principal secretary, family planning and welfare department, for further action. A 25-year-old patient from Bhaumazra tehsil in Khanna was admitted to the civil hospital on May 12, 2015, and referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, saying that she had hepatitis-B and low haemoglobin. This wasn't the first incident of referral of HIV cases from the civil hospital despite a show-cause notice to the SMO. Report also said according to the statement of Dr Garg, the patient had low haemoglobin, but notwithstanding the blood store at the hospital, she was referred. She could have developed complications like heart attack. However, Dr Manohar Lal, denying all allegations, said, \"Dr Garg informed me about the complications and I made her talk to the civil surgeon, after which she took the referral decision.

        "body": "MADURAI: The Madurai Network of Positive People's Society is trying to get a girl child, who was adopted by an HIV positive woman, enrolled in school, as the woman was unaware of the consequences when she decided to bring up this orphan as her own, four years ago. Speaking to TOI, B V Babu, president of the society said that the woman Jaya (name changed) (40) had enrolled in the society in 2009 a few weeks after she tested positive for HIV. \"She is one of those lucky ones where the virus had been dormant for over 15 years,\" said Babu, who himself had tested positive 13 years after being infected. The woman had told the society members that her husband left her 20 years ago after infecting her with the dreaded disease. The couple had a daughter, who was married off last year. However, the woman, who was employed as a sweeper in a private nursing home in Vadipatti near Madurai, hid her HIV condition from her daughter's in-laws. In the meantime, the woman applied for the Rs 1000 assistance given by the government to women who had been abandoned by their husbands. She had sought Babu's help for obtaining the same. After filing up her application, he asked her to meet him in his office. \"When she came on Tuesday, I was surprised to see her being accompanied by the four-year-old child,\" he said. When Babu inquired with the woman who the girl was, she told him that it was her daughter. \"Immediately, I questioned her how she could have such a daughter of that age when her husband had left her 20 years ago. I even asked her angrily if she had an affair,\" he said. That was when the woman broke down and narrated the story of the girl. She told him that the child was abandoned by her biological mother in the hospital where she worked and the authorities entrusted her with the duty of putting the child in the cradle baby scheme. \"I did not have the heart to abandon the child and decided to bring her up as my own as she would be of support to me,\" she said. Babu said that he found the woman's claims to be genuine and explained to her that what she had done in her ignorance was a grave mistake. She was told that the child would have to pursue a good education to become self-sustained in future. \"My only fear is that I will lose this daughter if I have to educate her with the help of officials,\" Jaya told TOI. Madurai district social welfare officer M Jayalakshmi told TOI that the woman was not justified in bringing up the child illegally. The child would immediately be handed over to the child welfare committee in Muthupatti and if there are no claimants, then the girl would be produced in court and her foster mother would have to make a claim from there. \"If the court deems her unfit to bring up the child, she would come under our care and we will take care of its proper adoption,\" she said. Enrolling the child in school is not an immediate possibility according to her."

Most of the children are under 14 years of age. \u201cThe idea of opening an orphanage for children came to my mind when I was working with Spandana network for the welfare of HIV positive people.

It is also among the six states that together account for 41% of new HIV infections. A March 2012 report by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) revealed that Surat and Ahmedabad are the two districts with the highest density of people undergoing anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and those detected as HIV positive. The data shows 1,012 patients were added to the HIV list in Gujarat as reported by government and NGO-run dispensaries. A total of 25,885 patients are undergoing ART in the state. Further, the number of children and adults undergoing ART doubled between January 2010 and 2012. Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) officials said this was because of increased surveillance and more nodal centres. Last year, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Chandigarh showed an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.31%, which was greater than national figure of 0.27%. Manipur had the highest HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%). GSACS figures show 5.85 lakh patients in the state were detected with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), of which 1,012 patients were HIV positive. Umesh Oza, in-charge project director of AMC Aids Control Society (ACS) said, \"Our pre-natal intervention with women patients is proving fruitful.

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. : The San Francisco Department of Public Health is drastically cutting funding for HIV treatment and prevention in the Asian American Pacific Islander community and has allocated no money to stem the spread of the virus in Asian American women whose rates of HIV infections are on the rise. Over the past four years, Asian Americans have had the highest increase in new HIV infections, going up from six percent to 10.3 percent. \"Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the HIV infection rate in A&PI communities will surpass that of Latinos by 2015 and of African Americans by 2020 if left unchecked,\" said Tri Do, an assistant adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, in an earlier story. Only 10 percent of API men and less than one percent of Asian American women have been tested for the HIV virus. San Francisco annually awards $9.7 million in funding to organizations within the city that work on HIV treatment and prevention. But the city is rolling out a new plan for prevention \u2013 known as New Directions \u2013 which primarily funds organizations working with Caucasian, African American and Latino gay men, according to API community advocates. \"Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,\" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone \u2013 an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2013 said. \"Surveys have consistently shown that the API community is one of the most vulnerable communities to new HIV infections and these budget cuts will only curtail the testing and awareness efforts taking place in earnest,\" he added. \"Allocating resources should correlate with consistent data that places API community in high risk category and not on how visible our community is. The department's decision clearly implies that our struggles - as the API community - do not matter,\" stated Mallajosyula. The SFDPH has cut its entire annual allocation of $350,000 to the Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, which claims to be the only organization in San Francisco working on HIV prevention with the API community. \"We've been funded by the City for 25 years,\" Lina Sheth, director of community development and external affairs at the A&PI Wellness Center, told India-West, adding that the organization would have to cut out its youth programs and drastically reduce its services to gay and bisexual men. The Wellness Center operates on an annual budget of $3.5 million, from federal funding and private grants and donations. The organization also does not have funding to provide direct HIV prevention to Asian American women in San Francisco. \"In the New Directions program, women are completely excluded,\" stated Sheth, noting that API women tend to get tested at very late stages, when they already have AIDS. \"As a community, we are very family-oriented, and the stigma of having AIDS is so deep, we wouldn't want to dishonor our family by saying we have it,\" said Sheth, explaining why more APIs do not get tested for the virus. The Indian American community needs \"culturally competent\" organizations to provide HIV prevention services. But Grant Colfax, director of the HIV Prevention and Research Section in the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office, said the City would ensure that APIs received HIV prevention. \"They have not been cut out of the budget,\" he told India-West. The New Directions program has allocated funds proportionately within ethnicities, dedicating the biggest allotment to high-risk groups, said Colfax. According to data from the SFDPH, Caucasian, African American and Latino gay males are at the highest risk for acquiring new HIV infections, along with transgendered men and intravenous drug users. Asian Americans represented 11 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, and 8.7 percent of people living with AIDS. Colfax said his budget was based on AIDS data for 2010, and added that 8.7 percent of funding \u2013 roughly $844,000 \u2013 would be allocated to organizations working on HIV prevention in the API community. Asked to name such organizations, Colfax pointed to Magnet, an organization for gay men which offers free sexual health services, including HIV testing. Magnet, however, has no APIs on its staff or advisory board and its Web site featured no Asian American men. There is no evidence of an increase in HIV infections among Asian American women in San Francisco, stated Colfax, adding that the SFDPH is working to make HIV testing a routine part of health care screenings. In an Aug. 1 meeting with several lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations, Colfax acknowledged that APIs were a \"gap population\" and promised to look at additional options for HIV prevention for Asian Americans.

An eight-month-old baby boy suffering from hydrocephalus (a condition of accumulation of fluids in the brain) was scheduled to be operated at around 2 pm on Monday but the surgery started only around 7 in the evening. The child was kept hungry throughout the day, alleged his parents. Neurosurgeons, who carried out the operation, alleged that the delay was due to the anaesthetist, who came in late. The surgeons waited for over five hours in the OT. The anaesthetist attended the operation only after the intervention of the hospital superintendent. \"We had informed the anaesthetist about the surgery in the morning but he did not turn up. We waited for five hours to carry out the operation,\" head of the neurosurgery department S S Mishra alleged. There are allegations that the anaesthetist was hesitant to attend to a HIV positive patient. Refuting the allegations, the anaesthetist Narayan Acharya said, \"The delay in operation has nothing to do with the patient being HIV positive. The child was very sick and special intervention as venesection (where a vein is surgically opened to obtain intravenous access) was required to administer anaesthesia to the patient. But the doctors had not completed the preparations for the surgery on time. I had visited the ward twice but the surgery was delayed due to lack of co-ordination on their part.\" But the worst sufferer was the child and his parents. \"The day was painful for us. We also suffered along with our child. The hospital allotted us time for surgery 20 days after admission. But the doctors delayed the process,\" mother of the child said, who had come all the way from Balipadar in Ganjam district. Monday's problem also brought to the fore the insufficient number of anaesthetist in the hospital. Doctors have demanded a team of anaesthetist for the critical department like neuro-surgery. \"Over 30 patients are waiting for surgery in the ward but we are unable to operate them due to unavailability of anaesthetist. We are demanding for special anaesthetist for the department since the past few years but we have not got any yet,\" Mishra said."

        "body": "CHENNAI: After years of providing treatment, care and support for HIV/AIDS among high risk groups like truckers, commercial sex workers, injectable drug users and transgenders, the government is suddenly faced with a new challenge -- the increasing incidence of HIV among youth, possibly due to unsafe casual sex. Concerned by the trend, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) is organising a youth carnival to create awareness and promote safe sex. The state has been boasting about a decline of infection in the population, but those working in the HIV/AIDS sector fear that there is an increase in the incidence of the disease. A recent analysis undertaken by TNSACS has shown that the profiles of the newly infected people were not from the high risk groups. \"Instead they were housewives, single working people and students. We also did a study on usage of condoms among youth. That's when we found that many have occasional unprotected intercourse with multiple partners,\" said Dr. S.Thennarasu, the regional coordinator. Other senior officals in TNSAC confirmed the trend. \"The infection rate is high only within the age-group of 15-29 years. Today, casual sex has a fair amount of social acceptance. Mobility amidst both sexes is on the rise,\" the official added. Others working in the sector agree. \"There is a clear decline in the HIV prevalence rates among sex workers and truckers. In a small study we found that casual sex among working professionals particularly those in garment industry and the BPO sector was high.\" said Dr R Lakshmibai, the project director of TAI. As per data furnished by the TNSAC, the prevalence of HIV among commercial sex workers had decreased from 8.8% in 2003 to 3.6% in 2007. Consequently, even prevalence of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases(STD) had decreased from 16.8% in 2000 to 8% in 2007. However, the state registered a total of 28,000 cases in 2008-09 and 30,000 new cases in 2009-10. \"There were only basic awareness programs conducted for the general population. Otherwise, we focused only on target groups. It's probably time to change that,\" said an official. TNSACS, in association with APAC and TAI will organise a youth carnival in August that will attempt to sensitise them to the dangers of unsafe sex with strangers. \"Intercourses with multiple partners is always risky,\" explained Dr Bimal Charles, project director of Aids Prevention and Control Project (APAC). \"And the youth are always prone to experimentation. If they are not aware of safety, it increases the risk.\" The Carnival will attempt to create awareness through mediums the youth relate to, like video and short film competitions on the issue, workshops, jingles and jazzy numbers. \"Already, the few interactions that we had with the youth helped us realise that they were hungry for information on this topic.\""

Ravji Sondarva, 33, a Rohitdasnagar resident of Junagadh, lodged a complaint with B division in Junagadh against the civil surgeon, the staff of its pathology laboratory and the staff of Sarvoday Blood Bank (Civil Hospital, Junagadh) under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 308 (attempt to culpable homicide), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed). This follows the Gujarat high court order that a police complaint be registered in the case. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed regarding the tragedy on September 24. Those who tested HIV positive are among 100 thalassaemic children from Junagadh district, who have been coming to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. Thalassaemia is a hereditary blood disorder which results in excessive destruction of red blood cells leading to anaemia. Hence, thalassaemics need regular blood transfusions to stay alive. There are more than 4,500 thalassaemic children in the state. The issue came into light about four months ago when 23 thalassaemic kids tested HIV positive in a surprise check at Junagadh Civil Hospital. The administration had turned a deaf ear to the demand of parents of the affected kids that a complaint be filed against those responsible."

Talking to TOI, director ASC Prof H K Sharma said that in 2007, UGC had sanctioned Rs 40 lakh for the ASC under the XIth Five Year Plan. The commission had allocated Rs 75 lakh to all universities that already had ASC and communicated that once the university concerned spends Rs 75 lakh and settles the expenditure, the UGC would provide another Rs 75 lakh for enhancing facilities for the faculty members coming to university concerned for refresher courses at ASC and other activities of the college. Under the scheme, the AU too received Rs 40 lakh. The UGC assured that the remaining amount of the sanctioned Rs 75 lakh would be provided once the varsity utilizes the amount. The then ASC director Prof Pratima Gaur made several efforts to utilize the sanctioned amount on the campus but in vain. As years passed, the interest accrued on Rs 40 lakh came to around Rs 5 lakh. Following efforts of vice-chancellor Prof AK Singh and current ASC director Prof HK Sharma it was decided that the amount would be utilized in constructing additional seven rooms in the AU guest house. The construction work launched a couple of months back is in full swing to ensure that the project is completed by April, this year. \"Land was a problem. We decided that rooms can be constructed anywhere and thus the idea of guest house extension came up. These rooms would accommodate three visiting faculty members. Preference would be given to those coming to ASC and when there is no booking for ASC, the same rooms would be given to faculty members or guests of AU\", said Prof Sharma."

Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. \u201cTo check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV in donated blood,\u201d Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme. Hepatitis A and E, the commonest forms of viral hepatitis, spread mainly through contaminated food or water. The state health minister said that they are taking all measures to ensure clean drinking water facility to all citizens. The Delhi government is also planning to provide increased financial assistance to poor patients undergoing liver transplant, kidney transplant and other super-specialty procedures \u2014 Rs 3 lakh for those undergoing treatment at private hospitals and Rs 5 lakh for those being treated by government hospitals. According to Dr Shiv Sarin, director, ILBS, hepatitis rarely presents symptoms until very late. \u201cFor example, a person infected with hepatitis C virus may carry the virus for as long as 10 years or even 20 years without presenting any obvious symptom. Regular health check-up is advised for people above 40 years of age,\u201d he said."

        "body": "PATNA: With two new anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres likely to become functional in the state by the year-end, HIV carriers can expect better availability of the therapy. The new ART centres are coming up at Rajendra Memorial Research Institute-Patna and Anugrah Narain Medical College and Hospital-Gaya. The state already has four ART centres at Patna Medical College and Hospital, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital-Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital-Laheriasarai and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital-Bhagalpur. ART centres provide facilities like counselling, pathological tests for assessing the CD4 count and free medicines, if required. Bihar has at present 13,539 HIV+ persons registered with the existing ART centres. Of them, 6,478 have been put on ART therapy. This therapy is started once the CD4 count falls below 200. \"Dedicated manpower has already been deputed for the two new ART centres which will become functional once the civil work is completed by December-end,\" Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) additional project director Sibi Alex told TOI. He said some of the patients registered with the existing ART centres would be shifted to the new ones. This would not only rationalise the distribution of workload to the ART centres but also reduce the distance the HIV+ patients have to cover to reach these centres. Plans are also afoot to start 19 link ART centres in addition to the existing five. \"This would further make things easier for the HIV+ cases,\" Alex said. The link ART centres free the HIV+ patients of the vicinity from the monthly chore of coming to the ART centres as they get counselling and medicines at the link ART centres. They, however, have to come to the ART centres for the CD count test every six months. The five link ART centres which have recently been made functional are at Nawada, Begusarai, Saran, Hajipur and Mokama. The process of linking HIV+ cases of these areas with the link centres is on. The new link ART centres are likely to become functional within the next three months in Bhojpur, Gopalganj, Arwal, Lakhisarai, Samastipur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Munger, Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia, Araria, Khagaria, Nalanda, Siwan, Jehanabad and Aurangabad districts."

Both natives of nearby Andlu village, the NRIs had got to know about the miseries of the girls after the issue was raised by The Times of India, so in their next visit to India, they landed up at girls` place to offer help. Ajit Singh Grewal residing in England and his relative Sukhjinder Singh from USA said after they came across a news item about three sisters losing both their parents to AIDS, have decided to help the destitute. Both the NRIs brought clothes for sisters and said they would collect money from other NRIs and would provide financial assistance for the education of the three girls. Ajit Singh said upon returning from UK, he along with Sukhjinder tried hard to find the girls. Seeing them living in such pathetic conditions, they decided to help the girls. The NRIs said Kila Raipur MLA Jassi Khangura too had called upon them to help out the poor girls. NRIs said they were pleased to know that Barnala deputy commissioner Arshdeep Singh Thind too had provided some assistance to the girls through the Red Cross. The NRIs asked the girls` grandmother to approach them whenever they need any help apart from regular assistance. The three sisters lost their mother to AIDS on August 2, 2010. Six months earlier their father, a truck driver, too, had died of the disease. After their father`s death, their mother too was found suffering from AIDS and TB."

        "body": "KOLHAPUR: Dismal response from the maternity homes in the city has created a hurdle for the Kolhapur district AIDS control unit to track and secure HIV-affected expectant mothers. In the last two years, only 17 maternity clinics in the limits of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) the have joined the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) project. Interestingly, more than 100 registered clinics and hospitals exist in the KMC\u2019s limits. Scared of another burden of documentation, the gynaecologists are staying out of the project, which was started by the Kolhapur unit in April 2013. The dull response has stalled the efforts of the unit to provide necessary help to HIV-infected expectants mothers and start necessary medication at the earliest. In the district, altogether 58 maternity homes have been registered for the project, which is being implemented by Pune-based NGO Prayas. The NGO and the unit have jointly discovered 16 cases of HIV positive expectant mothers with the help of maternity homes so far. \u201cWe were able to provide them assistance on time only because of the response from the maternity homes. Otherwise these mothers could have gone undetected and had given birth to HIV positive babies,\u201d said Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of the Kolhapur unit. As part of the PPTCT project, the unit and Prayas jointly provide free kits to the hospitals, which they can use to detect whether the expectant mother is HIV-affected. If the results are positive, the hospitals are supposed to inform the unit. Thereafter, the unit and Prayas teams take care of the patient\u2019s medication. \u201cWe only require them to inform us; we don\u2019t demand anything else. We are constantly in touch with the city\u2019s gynaecologists and could enroll 17 of them for the project. However, we need almost all of them to join the project to make ensure that the city has zero HIV prevalence, especially among children,\u201d Shipurkar added. Since April 2013, maternity homes in city and districts have come across 20,000 patients and found 16 HIV positive cases. Now, after receiving lukewarm response from the doctors, Prayas is reaching out to the pathologists to get details about HIV positive expectant mothers. \u201cBesides these 17 hospitals in the city, we have a good network in Karvir and Hatkanangale talukas. Earlier, one of the hospitals in Jaysingpur was reluctant to join the project. However, it found an HIV positive case on the very first day of implementation of project. Since then, the hospital is helping us consistently. A few such big hospitals in the city are joining voluntarily. However, we desperately require 100% coverage,\u201d said Raju Misal, programme officer of PCCT project, Prayas. Misal said the NGO is contacting pathologists in the city asking them to participate in the drive. \u201cWe will train their staff, provide them free kit on HIV detection, and will go to their laboratories to collect the results. We hope to receive good response in coming days,\u201d he added."

Doctors said it is clear now that the child has been infected through blood transfusion. \"It is now proved beyond doubt that the complainants are the biological parents of the baby,\" District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) M Gopi Naik told TOI on Sunday. The controversy has been raging since the past four months when the child was found to be HIV positive at a private hospital where she had been admitted for treatment of pneumonia. Doctors there had used blood from a local blood bank for transfusion when the condition of the child turned critical . But when the baby tested positive for AIDS a week later, the shocked parents approached the police and district authorities. The child was then shifted to the Government General Hospital (GGH ) for treatment and cops registered cases against the doctors, promoting several from the medical fraternity to protest. Doctors at the private hospital and officials at the blood bank refuted any culpability. Later, the district collector set up a committee, including DHMP Gopi Naik, which went through the records at the private hospital and blood bank . Reports at the time of the child's birth showed her to be HIV negative. The parents as well as the blood donor, who was traced after the controversy erupted, also tested negative. Meanwhile, the mystery deepened when GGH superintendent Mohan Rao found the records of the child tampered with, marking the baby as HIV positive at the time of birth itself. The government hospital authorities raised suspicion that it was the handiwork of the private hospital management in order to wash their hands off the issue. At this stage, the Indian Medical Association raised doubts whether the parents had adopted the child and sent their samples for a DNA test. Even before the paternity test report came, the district collector handed over the inquiry to the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS ) . APSACS joint director Jayachandra Reddy, who conducted an in-camera inquiry with the medical officers, GGH staff and met collector Suresh Kumar on Saturday, said he would submit a report shortly."

        "body": "Bengaluru: An HIV-affected person doesn\u2019t immediately develop AIDS; in fact it\u2019s the final stage. However, as HIV-1 has a unique ability to lie dormant for years, the virus-affected cells will have to be continuously monitored to plan the treatment. So, here comes a non-invasive biosensor that can measure what is going on within HIV-1 infected cells in real time, all thanks to a joint research by teams from IISc here and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (ICGEB) and Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. Scientists said that the technology can offer insights that can help in controlling AIDS infection and also provide insight on interactions between HIV-1 and the tuberculosis causing bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),within the cells. The team has devised a non-invasive biosensor methodology for precise measurements of glutathione (GHS), an anti-oxidant which works as a protective shield. Glutathione levels are indicators of the level of infection. The team says fluctuation of GSH levels detected by the biosensor also helps understand the expression of antioxidant genes and related pathways during latent and active stages of infection. \u201cEarlier methods use whole cell or tissue extracts, which destroy detailed information related to the GSH levels in different areas within an infected cell. We\u2019ve discovered that a modest increase in oxidative stress is sufficient to reactivate virus from latency. This may allow researchers to adopt a \u2018shock-and-kill\u2019 strategy in which virus could be reactivated by oxidative stress inducing compounds and subsequently killed by current anti-HIV drugs,\u201d the team\u2019s study says. Amit Singh of IISc says the sensitivity and specificity of this biosensor could be further used in understanding the physiological changes in HIV-1 infected cells and the mechanism of drug action. Importantly, he says, \u201cWe also discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, another major human pathogen, specifically disturbs glutathione balance to increase the replication of HIV. Since TB is the major cause of HIV related deaths, our findings have major mechanistic and therapeutic potential for both TB and AIDS (among the main causes of human death).\u201d According to information from the ministry of health and family welfare, Karnataka has 1,07,664 AIDS patients and 6,751 of them are below the age of 15 (see table)."

His incident has brought to the fore the grim reality of the high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are not aware of their status. The recently released data of people, who donated blood in the last one financial year in the entire state, shows that among the donors as many as 819 were HIV positive. These people are not aware of the fact that they are carriers of the virus. All donated bloods are subjected to laboratory tests and if found HIV positive, are completely destroyed. Statistics show that there are 83 registered blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacement. In the last financial year, around 555 people went to the camps orgainsed by social organizations, hospitals and blood banks and donated blood voluntarily. Of the 4,57,304 people who donated blood from April 2010 to March 2011, 819 donors were found positive for HIV implying that one out of 558 people, who donated blood was carrying the AIDS virus. According to the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus. The society stated that one should take blood only from a licenced blood bank where it is tested for HIV. Jaipur, which has highest number of blood banks in the state, found 326 such cases registered in the last financial year. In Jodhpur, such cases were recorded at 90, Ajmer 47, Alwar 44, Bhilwara 27, Udaipur 40 and in Bikaner 25 such cases were found. In 2008, around 3,90,899 people had donated blood out of which 764 were HIV positive, and in 2009 the figure increased to 808, in the same year 3,94,917 people had donated blood. The state government is now taking the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS where folk artistes were roped in to interact with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease."

The court refused to allow the plea of public prosecutor, Taufiq Ahmed, seeking capital punishment for the man on the grounds that he took law into his hands over a minor dispute. While awarding the life sentence, the court took into account several mitigating factors like the convict is HIV positive and committed the crime on the spur of the moment under the influence of alcohol. Murder is punishable with life imprisonment or death penalty. \"No doubt, all murders are most degrading and depraving but the case in hand certainly does not fall within the category of rarest of rare or least even in category of rare case,\" the court said. It also noted that the victim, Rajbir, was murdered because he tried to intervene in the ongoing quarrel between his friend, Ravi Kumar, and the convict. The fact that the convict was facing charges in two pending criminal cases also went against him. The convict, who was inebriated, had hit Rajbir on his neck and face with a broken beer bottle on December 19, 2008, in Ashok Vihar here, resulting in his death.

        "body": "WASHINGTON: A novel method of altering a protein in cow's milk to bind with an antiretroviral drug promises to greatly improve treatment for infants and young children suffering from HIV/AIDS, according to a new study. One of the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection, Ritonavir, has undesirable side effects and important oral-delivery problems. Its physicochemical properties challenge its administration to infants, said Federico Harte, associate professor of food science at Pennsylvania State University. \"Ritonavir has a high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water, which lead to a low dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal fluid and, hence, to insufficient bioavailability. \"The liquid formulation used to treat infants over one month of age contains 43 per cent ethanol and has an awful flavour that has been described as bitter-metallic, medicinal, astringent, sour and burning,\" Harte said. \"Moreover, when coming into contact with the stomach mucosa, Ritonavir causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Therefore, we need to develop alternative paediatric formulations of Ritonavir and overcome its poor water solubility to improve its oral administration to infants and children,\" added Harte. To solve that problem, Harte looked to a group of proteins in cow's milk celled caseins. Casein proteins form spherical aggregates called casein micelles, which are responsible, incidentally, for the white colour of milk. The casein micelles in mammals' milk are natural delivery systems for amino acids and calcium from mother to young, and might deliver Ritonavir molecules as well, Harte said. \"I have been working with bovine casein micelles for a few years now, and we have investigated the structure and functionality of these proteins,\" he said. \"What we found is these micelles are able to carry molecules that have very little solubility in water, that have low molecular weight and that are very hydrophobic - such as Ritonavir,\" said Harte. Harte discovered that subjecting milk to ultrahigh-pressure homogenisation enhances the binding properties of the casein micelles. Milk was homogenised at between 400 and 500 megapascals, disassociating the casein micelles and improving the protein's binding qualities to attach to drug molecules. An estimated 3.4 million children are living with HIV/AIDS, according to the World Health Organisation. Nine out of 10 of them live in resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where effective antiretroviral treatments still are not widely accessible or available, researchers said. The research was published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Research."

It, thereafter, dropped to 161 in 2011,only to rise exponentially to 413 till October, 2012, according to official sources. The border district of Kishanganj, hedged in by Nepal on one side and Bangladesh on the other side, has been most vulnerable to the HIV+ menace. The huge migration of labourers to distant places and perennial problem of human trafficking only adds to the phenomenon, according to sources. In view of the district\u2019s susceptibility and vulnerability to the menace of HIV, Kishanganj was one of the seven districts in the country and the only district in Bihar where the World Health Organisation (WHO)) had launched the CHARCA programme to contain AIDS in 2004. However, the CHARCA programme was wound up in 2005, sources said. The Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) is actively campaigning to control the menace of AIDS. Altogether 32,598 persons, both male and female, were made to go through the grill of testing at various camps throughout the district.

Sinha further said last year 102 school teachers from Patna district were imparted training on creating awareness about the disease. \u201cThe district magistrate will decide whether those teachers will be involved in the awareness programme during the arrival of the train,\u201d he said."

        "body": "CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu, which even 10 years ago had an alarmingly high incidence of HIV infection, has dropped from third to fifth among states with the largest number of people infected with the deadly virus. Tamil Nadu previously ranked in the top three with 1.54 lakh HIV-positive people, it has now been overtaken by Karnataka (2.45 lakh), and West Bengal (1.67 lakh). Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show. Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). \u201cAround 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,\u201d said a TNSACS official. \u201cIn 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000. That\u2019s a decrease of 7,000 new cases in two years.\u201d Activists attribute the success of the state\u2019s AIDS programme to the commitment of the health sector and the government. \u201cTamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,\u201d said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative. \u201cNational AIDS Control Organisation has recommended the model to other states.\u201d The state has benefitted from specialized target intervention programmes that go beyond focusing on vulnerable groups such as sex workers, said M Ramar of Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research in Coimbatore who runs intervention programs for migrant workers. \u201cOnce we started targeting their clients, which spans various groups like migrant workers, truckers and youngsters, things started looking better,\u201d Ramar said. \u201cI see a sense of awareness among migrant workers here. Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.\u201d According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. \u201cThere are three levels \u2014 nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.\u201d Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. \u201cTrends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,\u201d she said. \u201cAgencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.\u201d The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. \u201cThe first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,\u201d Dr Lakshmibai said."

Lokeshwar, who's also the speaker of Manipur legislative assembly, said the forum will support the battle against stigma and discrimination and ensure that the marginal communities are brought to the mainstream. Speaking as chief guest on the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial observation here on Sunday, he lauded the role played by HIV positive people and drug users in leading the struggle for protection of rights and decreasing the spread of the HIV epidemic. Manipur is one of the six states in the country with widespread prevalence of HIV/AIDS. According to the Manipur Aids Control Society (MACS), the state has 38,573 HIV positive people and 698 have died of the disease till March 2011. Till May 2001, 19,455 people have registered for Anti Retroviral Therapy. Drawing the attention of the MACS project director to the unfinished task of revising the state AIDS policy, legislator I Ibohanbi Singh said policies are a must for tackling issues like HIV and AIDS. \"The draft state AIDS policy needs to be tabled at the earliest and discussed threadbare so that our response to the epidemic is in tune with the needs of the community. We need commitment and the gap between NGOs implementing HIV-related programmes and MACS has to be bridged so that the need of vulnerable communities are addressed,\" he said. MACS project director Sailesh Kumar Chourasia said the event, based on the theme 'Promoting Health and Dignity Together', gave the people an opportunity to look at what they have achieved so far and, more importantly, chart out a future course of action to sustain the effort. Different departments need to come together if we want to respond to the epidemic in a holistic manner, he said. Sixteen civil society organizations, human rights groups, lawyers, drug users, nupi manbi (transgenders) and positive networks and NGOs in the state joined the observation. The memorial function kicked off on Saturday with a painting competition for children affected by HIV and AIDS. It will continue as a year-long state-level campaign for solidarity in fighting the epidemic."

        "body": "HYDERABAD: Guntur district, which forms part of the AP state capital region, tops the list of HIV positive cases in the state. The district also had the dubious distinction of being the \"HIV capital' in undivided Andhra Pradesh in the last two years. If the data available with Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) is any indication, Guntur had the highest number of HIV positive cases since 2012-13. Guntur district registered 5,195 (including 2,498 female) HIV positive cases during 2013-2014 and 6,027 cases (2,938 female) during the previous year. Hyderabad, which tops the HIV positive chart in Telangana state, reported 3,952 (2,525 female) cases during 2013-14. APSACS conducts sampling of HIV cases in general population for both men and women, and pregnant women at antenatal care units separately every three months. The data shows that though the number of cases had come down in Guntur and Hyderabad, HIV positive cases have gone up in AP post bifurcation. In AP, East Godavari has the second highest number of HIV positive cases (4,191 in 2013- 2014 and 5,598 cases in 2012-2013). West Godavari with 3,644 cases in 2013-2014 and 3,953 cases in 2012-2013 stands third. Districts Krishna, Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Chittoor, Nalgonda, Nellore, Kadapa, Mahbubnagar, Anantapur, Prakasam, Khammam, Kurnool, Medak, Karimnagar, Rangareddy, Warangal, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Adilabad follow suit. Mahbubnagar tops the list in the number of cases of pregnant women affected by AIDS. Officials attribute the high prevalence in Krishna, Guntur, and East and West Godavari districts to the presence of more number of ports and heavy traffic on national highways. \"Though we are able to convince people that one can live long even after contracting HIV, about 20% of HIV positive cases lose hope and stop taking medicines,\" said an official. APSACS will soon develop district-level societies for AIDS control with single window system for the benefit of patients. Meanwhile, APSACS secured permission from National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) for AP and Telangana units. A separate AIDS control society will be created for T state. APSACS has been faced with fund crunch for the last one year. The allocation from NACO has come down from Rs 158 crore during the last financial year to Rs 121 crore this year. This is due to reduction in fund flow to NACO from international donors."

        "body": "Mumbai's AIDS control body, in an RTI, has revealed that 85 people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while getting blood transfusion in the last three years. The numbers, though based on voluntary disclosure of clients visiting HIV testing centres, have raised serious concerns about safety and testing protocols at blood banks in the city. The RTI response by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 18 got HIV through infected blood in 2015-16. The infections more than doubled (42) in 2014-15. In 2013-14, 25 infections were attributed to blood transfusion.The disclosure came as the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) claimed that transfusion-transmitted infections are largely restricted to rural areas with limited medical infrastructure. Government agencies fighting HIV in the city are clueless about the source of the untested blood. \u201cWe were told there is no mechanism to trace the source of the infected blood or find out which bank supplied it.It is a worrying situation,\u201c said Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI. The numbers were collated from integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) at all major public hospitals of the city. MDACS said only a miniscule percentage of HIV cases in the city are caused by infected blood. \u201cThe heterosexual route is still responsible for more than 90% infections. Out of the 8,000odd cases detected in the city annually, only 0.02% is attributable to blood transfusion,\u201c said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS. Activists, however, felt blood banks have a major role to play. \u201cAs per rules, when a donor turns out to be HIV positive, heshe must be informed and referred to the centres. But most blood banks don't do it,\u201c said an employee of a leading blood bank who has been advocating safe blood. He insisted the blood donor, unaware of his status, continues to donate blood. \u201cIf he is within the 3-6month window, the ELISA test used to check blood in most banks won't be able to detect the virus,\u201c he said. Therefore, a huge emphasis should be on pre-donor counselling. \u201cA detailed history of the donor before blood donation, where they are asked open questions about their lifestyles, can significantly bring down infection. But, unfortunately, at most blood camps, it is looked at as a waste of time,\u201c said Dr Zarine Bharucha, chairperson, Federation of Bombay Blood Banks (FBBB). Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges. A pathologist told TOI there is a staff shortage at most banks. \u201cBlood is not tested for days or there is shortage of kits. This can lead to false negativity or positivity,\u201c the doctor said."

And it\u2019s a positive sign as until a few years ago, the infection rate from mother-to-child was 25% across the country. Now it is 5%.\u201d The number of cases of HIV transmission from mother to child had come down from nine in 2013-14 to one in the last fiscal. \u201cThis year we checked 55 infants and there has been not a single case of mother-to-child infection,\u201d he added. He said it is encouraging that the government in July had issued a directive to all HIV-positive patients start ART, irrespective of their CD4 count. CD4 cells fight infections, but the HIV virus kills them. Medical experts at the ART centre said, if diagnosed and treated early with proper ART, HIV-positive patients can live for over 30 years. For the convenience of patients, the health department has started four ART Link centres in Manmad, Chandwad, Yeola and Niphad. Health officials said over the years there has been a dip in the number of patients registered as HIV positive."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Government is now planning to rope in its foot soldiers to prevent the spread of HIV from expecting mothers. Midwives or 'dayis' will be soon allowed to do HIV testing. The health ministry is set to issue a notification allowing midwives trained by the government to conduct HIV testing on pregnant women to diagnose the infection at an early stage, a source said. The idea is to make testing more accessible in order to prevent parent to child transmission of HIV or AIDS virus. \"Prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV virus is an essential part of AIDS control programme. While such testing is often available and conducted in a good hospital setting, it is not the same in rural areas and distant villages. Most of the time HIV screening does not happen even at public health centres (PHCs),\" says Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager at Aids Healthcare Foundation India. According to the source, mid-wives will be trained by state and district AIDS control organizations to conduct rapid tests to check HIV virus. Rapid tests are cold blood tests done through finger pricking. Mid-wives will be allowed to do the tests anytime during the pregnancy prior to delivery. The health ministry is likely to issue the notification by end of this month allowing midwives to do such tests. \"At a later stage, the government may even consider allowing ayurvedacharyas or AYUSH doctors to carry on these tests,\" the source said. Experts say early screening or diagnosis in pregnant women is crucial because if one tests positive than through procedures and interventions the spread of the virus to the unborn child can be prevented. \"There is an urgent need for India to upgrade to community based testing to increase accessibility and out reach,\" Mohanty said. Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus. Currently, India has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world, according to estimates of United Nations."

The window period is phase between contracting HIV and detection of virus in patients. According to doctors, blood banks rely heavily on ELISA test to screen HIV-carrier patients. \u201cELISA test is not a confirmatory test for detecting HIV in its window period among blood donors. It poses high risk even though blood banks screen patients on different parameters. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method is the only confirmatory test to detect HIV in its window period. The test is hardly done in any of the blood banks. It should be introduced in tertiary care centres,\u201d said MYH blood bank in charge Ashok Yadav. Choithram Hospital, head of pathology department, Dr DS Chitnis, said, \u201cWe opt for fourth generation Elisa test, which enhances chances of detection of HIV at an early stage. It is the latest available test.\u201d However, experts do not suggest the test as it does not confirm chances of the virus among patients. Medical education department Dr SS Kushwah said, \u201cAs per government policies, currently, Elisa test is being used to screen blood for HIV though it is not a confirmatory test.\u201d Indore has highest number of HIV/ AIDS-infected patients in state and most blood banks rely on professional donors."

The pregnant woman, who hails from a village under Gola block of Ramgarh district, gave birth to a child after a 14-hour ordeal. While she was in labour, one of the nurses assisting her was mistakenly pricked by the needle meant for the woman. Sources in the hospital said none of the medical staff was aware that the patients was HIV+ till her mother-in-law asked the nurses to administer her an injection meant for HIV positive mothers. This came as a shock to the medical staff and the nurse who was hurt by the needle used in the HIV positive woman. The nurse was immediately referred to Rims to run necessary medical tests on her. Confirming the news, Dr Ashok Ram, medical officer in charge of the government hospital, said the mother-in-law of the pregnant woman told him that her son is HIV positive so it\u2019s likely that her daughter-in-law may have got the infection too. However, he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm if the nurse is infected as the test reports are pending.\u201d Doctors at the government hospital suspect that the newborn too is HIV positive. Hospital sources said the names of the HIV positive couple are registered with Rims and the doctors there had asked them to get admitted in Rims at the time of delivery. Dr Ramesh Kumar Srivastava at Rims said no pathological test could immediately detect the virus. \u201cIf there is an accidental prick by an HIV-infected needle, the person must undergo prophylactic treatment at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Rims. No pathological test can immediately establish whether the person has got infected with HIV or not. But after a gap of three to four days, neuclic acid test can confirm the presence of Human Immune Viruses,\u201d said the professor of pathology at Rims. He added that such medical accidents are not rare and they often get cases related to doctors performing surgery on AIDS patients and being bruised or pricked accidently, but in most of the cases immediate ART treatment helps avert chances of being infected."

Statistics for recent years show that 75% of the state\u2019s HIV-positive pregnant women are under 25 and 50% are detected with the virus only at the time of their first delivery. At present, national policy allows only voluntary testing. \u201cIt is more than evident that the women are getting the infection from their husbands, \u201d said Ramesh D ev k a r, MSACS project director. Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune\u2019s National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92. \u201cWe have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,\u201d Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. \u201cThat means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,\u201d said Devkar. \u201cThe debate is between discrimination and the possibility of saving two lives.\u201d Many infected women support premarital HIV testing. Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: \u201cI have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died. Both I and my child would have been spared such a horrible life had pre-marital testing been mandatory.\u201d"

But while most AIDS patients see death staring at them, this gutsy 40-year-old woman and her 15-year-old son have refused to let the demon run havoc in their life. Aruna Sarkar's husband Sujoy committed suicide in 1999, unable to come to terms with the fact that he was HIV positive. By then he had already passed on the virus to Aruna and the couple's only son Debaditya. On World AIDS day the mother-son duo prays that no one in this world gets infected for no fault of theirs. Everything looked rosy for Aruna and Sujoy when they tied the knot in 1996. A few months later Sujoy left for Mumbai to work as radio officer with an oil major. He would come back to stay with his family in their Salt Lake house during leaves. It was during such trips home that his family noticed him falling ill often. Though Sujoy had got his HIV status detected in Mumbai, he did not dare share it with any of his family members, not even his wife. \"My husband probably could not accept that fact that he had the virus. In addition the guilt that he might have infected me and my son probably led him to commit suicide in July 1999. My son was a little less than two years then,\" Aruna recounted. There was worse to come. Sujoy's parents blamed Aruna for his HIV status and consequent suicide. She and the toddler were thrown out of the house. With advice from doctors, the mother-son got themselves checked and found that they were both infected. Since then they have been living with Aruna's parents in Baguiati. \"My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,\" Aruna told TOI. Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. \"I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,\" Debaditya said. \"The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible. In spite of being HIV-positive, she is not only bringing up her HIV-positive son single-handedly, but is also ensuring good education for him,\" said Dr Bhattacharya, a paediatric HIV specialist with NACO. Aruna and Debaditya are getting their anti-retroviral therapy free of cost, but she is concerned for her son's future. Often she has to seek financial help from NGOs for his education. \"The expenses of my son's education will only grow as he graduates into higher class. My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?\" wondered Aruna. While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex. \"I make it a point to stress upon the fact that none should have unprotected sex as it is a major source for HIV transmission. I do not want anyone to undergo the hardship I am going through. I can fight but not everyone might have the strength to do so,\" she added.

He urged insurance companies to reconsider the reasons for excluding of HIV+ patients from getting cover. The IRDA on Tuesday had announced guidelines giving insurance companies directions on portability. According to the new guidelines, any customer, dissatisfied with the services of his insurance company, has the option to switch to another company and carry his track record. \u201cThere are no issues considering health insurance portability with the insurance companies and we have got assurances from all of them. It will surely come into effect from October 1,\u201d Narayan said on the sidelines of a health insurance summit organized by the CII. Elaborating on the health portability scheme, Narayan said that only two things would be allowed to be carried forward. One, the time already spent in covering the pre-existing disease in one policy would be given credit and a policy holder will have the right to transfer no-claim bonus. However, the premium of the scheme will not be carried forward and would be decided by the new company. The new company would decide the coverage details of the scheme. The regulator is also looking into the issue of allowing banks to sell insurance products of more than one player. \u201cThe committee on bancassurance has recommended that banks be permitted with two insurance companies. Right now they can tie up with only one. But the issue is that there are certain weaknesses in current bank insurance companies. We are looking into whether the recommendations of the committee will check these gaps,\u201d said Narayan."

        "title": "This vaccine could help block HIV",
        "body": "WASHINGTON: Scientists have designed a new experimental HIV vaccine that may stimulate the immune system to block infection from the deadly virus. New research led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the Rockefeller University shows in mice that the vaccine candidate can stimulate the immune system activity necessary to stop HIV infection. The findings could provide key information for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine, researchers said. The research, published in the journals Cell and Science, represents a leap forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against HIV, which has so far struggled to elicit antibodies (immune system molecules) that can effectively fight off different strains of the virus. \u201cThe results are pretty spectacular,\u201d said Dennis Burton, chairman of the TSRI department of immunology and microbial science. While many vaccines for other diseases use a dead or inactive version of the disease-causing microbe itself to trigger antibody production, immunisations with \u201cnative\u201d HIV proteins are ineffective in triggering an effective immune response, due to HIV\u2019s ability to evade detection from the immune system and mutate rapidly into new strains. This challenge has led researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need a series of related, but slightly different proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV- a twist on the traditional \u201cbooster\u201d shot, where a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times. The scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer, using a technique called B cell sorting. The researchers showed that immunisation with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody \u201cprecursors\u201d \u2014 with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunisations against HIV, researchers said. \u201cThe vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to \u2018prime\u2019 the antibody response,\u201d said TSRI professor David Nemazee."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: A month after the Delhi government started registration of street-food vendors in the city, not many have managed to get a registration number as it can be done only online. To assist vendors in the registration process and educate them about food safety and standards, National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) held a special programme at Sarojini Nagar's Keshav Park on Tuesday. The Delhi government was one of the first to adopt the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, in 2011. But it failed to implement the scheme due to technical hurdles. Now that the process has started, civic society members, who have been fighting for it, don't want it to fail. NASVI has taken the initiative to rope in as many street food vendors as possible. Last year, the Delhi government and NASVI had identified eight markets-Sarojini Nagar, Tilak Nagar, Karol Bagh, Jheel, Paharganj, both sides of Nizamudin railway station and New Delhi railway station-where the pilot project would be implemented. \"We have started the project from Sarojini Nagar. We helped 125 street-food vendors register on Tuesday. We will continue the drive for the next one week and try to register all food vendors in the market,'' said Arbind Singh, national coordinator, NASVI. The programme was attended by over 100 vendors. \"I have been working for the past five years in Delhi. What they are teaching is new to me, but I feel this will help me in my business. I'll try to follow basic hygiene standards taught by them,\" Sajan Kumar Mandal, a street food vendor in Sarojini Nagar."

        "title": "SC forces govt to agree to second-line ART to all AIDS patients",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday tried everything -- from huge costs to irrational treatment by private hospitals -- to express reservations about extending second-line treatment to all HIV positive patients, but the Supreme Court used the right to life argument to counter them. The government had said it was willing to extend second-line treatment costing Rs 28,500 each to all patients except those irrationally treated by private hospitals. But a Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar wondered how the government could cite financial burden as a ground to deny treatment to a section that might have been irrationally treated by private hospitals. \"It is a question of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and the government cannot say finances are a constraint,\" the Bench said. Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam realised the weight of the Bench's logic and abandoned the financial constraint argument to clarify that the Centre was more concerned about the capacity to treat rather than finances. There were only 10 viral-load testing centres, he said. However, the capacity constraint argument too sounded far fetched as the SG himself pointed out that till now, the government had received data identifying only 122 HIV patients who might have been treated irrationally by private hospitals and possibly face the risk of not getting the second-line treatment, exclusively offered by centres run by government. In an affidavit before the SC, National AIDS Control Authority (NACO) had said second-line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners. It said such persons were either switched to second-line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second-line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases. Faced with the SC's right to life argument, Subramaniam clarified that \"if any such case (irrational treatment) came to government centres, we will do our best\". The Bench asked the SG to get a clarification next week about the Centre's stand on working out the modalities for treatment of HIV patients."

        "body": "MANGALORE: Exit lorry drivers, and construction and manual labourers, enter Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) workers in to the world of AIDS! May sound strange, but a recent survey carried out by Population Services International (PSI), a NGO involved in action against HIV/AIDS, has categorised KPO workers as the next major sector that would contribute to higher prevalence of reported AIDS case in Karnataka. Quoting this PSI survey report, Gurudas M Bhat, additional Labour Commissioner at the inaugural function of Hassan regional level dissemination workshop of National policy on HIV/AIDS and World of Work here on Tuesday, said KPO workers seem to be more vulnerable to contract AIDS as much as lorry drivers, and labourers were until the recent past. The latter category compared to the former seems to be more aware of AIDS, he said. Observing that most of the workers in KPO sector, including IT and ITES, BPO and call centres were youths, and staying alone, he said it is natural that they might try to fulfil their biological needs without paying heed to the consequences. Sustained awareness campaign conducted for lorry drivers, and construction workers is bearing fruits and most of them overcoming inhibitions prefer to go in for protected sexual intercourse, he noted. The survey only confirms that stereotypes of categories of people who were hitherto considered to be high risk group no longer is true and that prevalence of AIDS is seen across categories of people be it KPO workers, bank employees and so on. \"AIDS has broken class barriers and every section of population could find themselves vulnerable unless they are careful with their sexual indulgence and take precautions,\" he said. The spread of AIDS is having a bearing on gross domestic product that is taking a hit of one per cent because of people infected by the disease, he said. The disease is difficult to detect and Supreme Court guidelines also makes it amply clear that no potential employer can screen a target employee for the disease as it invades of the personal liberties of the individuals concerned. This underscores the need for individual integrity, he noted. G S Gopal, manager, Systems Strengthening, PSI Connect later told TOI that a 'Most at Risk' survey carried out by PSI that covered all sectors of work force found that certain sectors were now in high risk category. These included sugarcane workers in Bagalkot and Belgaum districts, garment workers in Bangalore, mines workers in Bellary, and construction workers and fishermen in coastal Karnataka, especially Mangalore."

The hospital, however, refuted the allegations and said she had been treated there twice earlier. Goregaon resident Ayesha (name changed) was admitted to the medical ward of G T Hospital around 11 am on Tuesday. However, she was discharged within half-an-hour and asked to go to surgical department. Ayesha alleged that first, she got admitted to the hospital only after waiting in the rain for 5 hours and intervention by senior doctors. Secondly, she claimed that, instead of discharging her, the doctors could have simply transferred her papers from one department to another (surgery). What upset her the most was that a resident medical officer allegedly told her that her HIV-positive status could pose a problem for both patients and doctors. She also claimed that she was forcefully handed over the Discharge Against Medical Advice (DAMA) papers. \"There is an abscess in my neck that has to be operated upon but doctors want me to go to some other hospital. They are worried that the HIV may pass on to others,\" Ayesha said. Later in the evening, social workers shifted her to St George Hospital. It's been two years now that she has been living with HIV, while her husband succumbed to the same ailment seven months ago. The hospital, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion by social workers. \"The patient had sought discharge against doctors' advice,\" said Dr A P Chaudhari, medical superintendent of G T Hospital. \"She was admitted to the wrong ward and I had asked my doctors to take her to the casualty and admit her again. We have many HIV+ patients and there is no reason to send her away.\""

She earns Rs 3,000 a month and gets free accommodation in the state capital. But, all was not well for her 10 years ago. This Class IX dropout, who hailed from Narayanpur village in Kendrapada district, was in her teens when she fell in love with Abhay Behera, a youth of her age. Abhay had just started working at a cloth factory in Surat. \"I eloped with Abhay against my family's wishes. It was for me a perfect married life. Well that is what I thought for the next few years,\" Sumitra recalls with a smile. \"Within two years, we were blessed with a baby boy. Both our families had also accepted us by then,\" she says. But she was oblivious of the fact that days after landing in Surat, she had contracted HIV from her husband in 2001. \"I was tested HIV+ during a routine pre-natal check-up during my first pregnancy in 2003. I must have contracted it much earlier, because my husband had been tested positive years ago. I got to know this just five years ago in 2006 during my second pregnancy,\" she narrated. \"Earlier, my husband had hidden his disease from me. He probably thought that since our son had tested negative, there was nothing to worry about. He had debarred me from breastfeeding him giving me some lame reasons, which I did not comprehend, but let go anyway,\" she said. When Sumitra was pregnant for the second time, her husband was suffering from high fever that required hospitalisation. They returned to Orissa to treat him. \"That is when he revealed to me our HIV+ status and said that he would not live long. He died two months later,\" Sumitra said. She then got worried and took another test in Kendrapada. There she tested positive. That was not all, her new-born child also tested positive a few months later. That is when she felt the world was crashing down on her. Even as she was trying to overcome the grief of her husband's death, villagers started avoiding her and almost ostracised her. \"Both the in-laws and my parents were reluctant to take me in. After much persuasion, my parents agreed to raise my elder son since he had tested negative,\" she recalls. \"I was thinking of ending my life along with my second child. But then, some HIV/AIDS volunteers counselled me,\" she said tearfully. With her month-old child in tow, Sumitra moved to Angul and started life afresh. She took a job of a maid for an NGO and in turn found shelter. Later, she moved to Bhubaneswar and joined a community centre for AIDS patients as an attendant. \"Although her profile is that of a house-keeper, she also helped counsel inmates using her own life story as a case in point,\" says Dr Dilip Samal, convenor of Medics, the NGO that runs the 10-bed indoor facility for AIDS patients. She gets Rs 3,000 a month and accommodation in return for her service. Interestingly, Sumitra has not fallen ill all these years. Nor has she undergone an anti-retroviral therapy. \"Her CD4 count (blood cell that gets affected in case of HIV) is good. She doesn't require medication,\" said Dr Samal. Besides, CD4 count of her younger son, Sivam Prakash, is improving. Sumitra gets to see her elder son Om Prakash once every three months when she travels to Kendrapada to collect her pension that she gets as a widow of an AIDS patient."

        "body": "ALLAHABAD: Officials of District Aids Programme Control Unit (DAPCU) swung into action following the report filed by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) terming around 132 villages as sensitive to HIV transmission. The UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) has now launched an extensive educational and awareness campaign with special attention on migrants. This extensive drive has been launched after five districts of UP including Allahabad, Mau, Deoria, Etawah and Banda were placed under 'category A' in terms of migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. Subsequently NACO is carrying out a special campaign in identified villages between June 13 and 27. NACO has also decided to carry out fourth phase of AIDS control programme in UP from October this year. According to the report, a total of 183 districts across the nation have been placed under 'category A' by NACO. Nodal officer, DAPCU, Dr OP Shahi told TOI that \"We have been carrying out extensive awareness campaign through 'folk art' to capture people's attention. Folk art like nukkad natak, nautanki, magic show, puppetry and kabbali are the best source of spreading awareness among people.\" He further added that under the first phase, awareness and educational camps will be held in 100 villages while remaining villages would be covered under the second phase. Dr Rohit Pandey, district programme manager, AIDS programme said that special camps are being held in 100 identified villages from June 13 to 27 while mass awareness camps in the same villages would be held between June 20 and July 4, 2013. He added that five villages each from 20 blocks of the district have been selected for awareness and educational progammes wherein migrants are being apprised about it too. Even as the officials will be collecting data of number patients from all 20 blocks of the district, they will also be carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment. Meanwhile, they will also be conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV. As far as route of infection and transmission categories are concerned, in 85.3 per cent cases, the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users respectively. Dr Shahi claimed under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities will be identifying those migrant labourers, truckers and homosexuals in the district as they are more vulnerable to the disease. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and homosexuals, so that concrete measures can be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been conducting awareness programmes under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme."

        "body": "LONDON: Scientists have developed a new ten times cheaper ultra-sensitive sensor test to detect the early stages of several cancers and viruses, including HIV, with the naked eye. Researchers from the Imperial College London claim that their visual sensor technology is ten times more sensitive than the current gold standard methods for measuring biomarkers. These indicate the onset of diseases such as prostate cancer and infection by viruses including HIV. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result. Researchers say their sensor would benefit countries where sophisticated detection equipment is scarce, enabling cheaper and simpler detection and treatments for patients. The team tested the effectiveness of the sensor by detecting a biomarker called p24 in blood samples, which indicates HIV infection. \"Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,\" Professor Molly Stevens, from the Departments of Materials and Bioengineering, said. \"Our approach affords for improved sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper, which could allow more tests to be performed for better screening of many diseases,\" said Stevens. Researchers also tested samples for the biomarker called Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is an early indicator for Prostate Cancer. The team say the sensor can also be reconfigured for other viruses and diseases where the specific biomarker is known."

Lack of awareness and social stigma pose the greatest obstacles in a vulnerable state like Assam. Prominent activist Jahnabi Goswami, the first woman from the northeast to declare herself HIV positive, rued that the social conditions are not conducive to fighting the disease. \"It is very unfortunate that we have failed to create mass awareness regarding HIV. If we continue to be secretive about the disease, we cannot stop it from spreading,\" Goswami, who realized that she was infected with HIV in 1996, told reporters during an interactive session at the Guwahati Press Club, on Saturday. Even professionals like doctors and health practitioners are not adequately aware, Goswami said, citing examples of how a Guwahati-based private hospital had refused to provide treatment to a 14-year-old boy and his mother because they were HIV positive. \"It's strange how professional people behave even now. If they continue to spread intolerance, how we can expect the lay man to know about the disease? Several people still shy away from disclosing that they are infected, fearing social stigma. HIV positive people like us have to be vocal if we want to stop this disease from spreading further,\" Jahnabi, who runs the Assam Network of Positive People (ANPP), an NGO to create awareness and to facilitate treatment of HIV positive people, said. She lauded the proactive role played by the churches in Mizoram in this regard. The scenario is not as encouraging in Assam, with religious and social institutions not showing much interest in spreading awareness about HIV. According to the Assam State AIDS Control Society, the tate currently has an estimated 12,804 HIV positive people, of which 396 are children Though there has been a countrywide decline of 50 per cent in the numbers, she said the infection of young people is a matter of concern. Jahnabi added that diagnostic or testing centres should target areas in the interior of the state so that the disease can be detected early as it is easier to treat. In the last stage, response to treatment becomes difficult. Goswami was born in 1976 and was brought up at Kampur village in Nagaon district. At the age of 18, she was married to a Guwahati-based businessman in 1994, without 'checking his antecedents.' In 1995, her husband passed away, leaving behind Jahnabi and their three-month-old daughter, Kastorika."

It is wrong to stereotype one particular section. If you talk about the city, there are approximately 4,600 people suffering from the disease,\u201d he said.

In her police complaint, 14-year-old survivor claimed that as part of a conspiracy, her elder sister took her to the market and then to a particular place on January 23 with the help of the accused, where they made her stay at a house belonging to an unknown woman. She added that later they took her to Nawanshahr where they kept her in some unknown woman's house. The complainant alleged that the accused later made her unconscious by giving her a sedative in tea after which he raped her. She added after regaining consciousness, the accused threatened to kill her if she revealed anything about the incident to anyone. Shimlapuri police have booked the sister of the girl for criminal conspiracy and her alleged boyfriend for rape and wrongful confinement. Investigating officer of the case Chaman Singh said the accused are yet to be arrested as the case is being investigated. He said the accused had an affair with the elder sister of the survivor. Police officials said the accused and girl's family knew each other for a long time. They added that medical examination of the girl is being done. In another case, Meherban police booked a man for trying to sexually abuse his minor daughter after getting drunk. In his police complaint, brother of 17-year-old survivor alleged that his sister and father were at home when he left for work on Wednesday. He added that after some time, he got a call from his sister telling him that father had got heavily drunk and is trying to sexually abuse her. The complainant said his sister also told him that father is not allowing her to go out. He added that as he reached home, his father threatened to kill them both after which he informed the police. Cops have booked the accused under Sections 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 354-B (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (criminal conspiracy)."

        "body": "VARANASI: It is not easy for a seven-year-old child living with HIV/AIDS or even his/her parents to talk about the miseries of life before the civil society. But, on the eve of the World AIDS Day, many children living with HIV/AIDS and their parents assembled in the city on Sunday and shared their life experiences and problems, like the discrimination and humiliation they faced in the society. Though there is a programme and facilities to control HIV/AIDS, most of them felt themselves excluded from the society. It was an initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS (UPNP+) with the support of UNICEF and Media Nest to give a voice to such persons and create awareness among people. Around 15 children from different districts including Varanasi, Chandauli, Jaunpur, Mirzapur and Bhadohi attended the programme. \"In Varanasi, there are 60 children of 5-14 age group who are infected with HIV,\" president of Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (BNP+) Manoj Kumar Singh informed TOI. According to him, the number of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) in the eastern UP is over 500. The Varanasi district has over 1,000 persons infected with HIV, and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP. The UNICEF report estimates that 70,000 children below the age of 15 are living with HIV in India and 21,000 children are infected every year through parent-to-child transmission. According to the 2009-10 annual report of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), demographically the second largest country in the world, India has also the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS. As per the provisional HIV estimate of 2008-09, there are an estimated 22.7 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in India. The HIV prevalence rate in the country is 0.29 per cent (2008-09) and most infections occur through heterosexual route of transmission. However, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, according to 2008 figures released by WHO. An estimated 2.7 million were newly infected with the virus and 2 million died of AIDS the same year. To take up the issue World AIDS Day is observed on December 1 to draw together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. In Varanasi, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. According to the records, so far over 11,000 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU. Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It mentors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. According Kulsum Talha of Media Nest, the children living with HIV should be heard and given due importance to fill them with a sense of respect. They should be encouraged to become a useful component of the society. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) III 2007-2012 has the overall goal of halting and reversing the epidemic in India. The NACP III places highest priority on prevention while seeking to integrate care, support and treatment for those affected by HIV/ AIDS."

        "body": "RAIPUR: In yet another case of blatant discrimination with HIV positive patients, staff of Dr BR Ambedkar Hospital\u2019s mortuary kept the dead body of an eight-year old orphaned child, who died because of the disease, on a stretcher in open, instead of cold storage, inside the morgue for over 15 hours on Tuesday evening, when the outside temperature was over 33 degrees Celsius. The body of the child, who died in hospital\u2019s ward-I on Tuesday evening, was shifted to the mortuary at about 7pm and left there in the open on a stretcher, as the staff members allegedly did not want to physically shift it to the refrigerated storage. Accusing the staff of discriminating against HIV patients, state advocacy officer of Vihaan Project (National AIDS Control Organisation), Amruta Alpesh Soni said the only reason why the morgue staff left the body on the stretcher was that they didn\u2019t want to lift it with their hands as the deceased had died due to HIV. Talking to TOI, Soni said she and her team were in the hospital on Tuesday night and they would have shifted the body if the morgue staff had even given them a hint. \u201cWe reached there on Wednesday morning around noon to collect the body and to our shock, found it lying in open at the same place where we had seen it last night,\u201d she said. Denying any motives behind the incident, forensic medicine department head Dr Ullas Gunade said, \u201cIt\u2019s a non-issue as bodies can be kept outside the freezer for 24 hours.\u201d However, Soni alleged that there were ants on the body when they picked it up. Accusing the government of doing little for HIV+ orphaned children, Soni said there about 400 such children in state and there is no rehabilitation policy for them, making their lives miserable. \u201cThese orphans have been left to fend for themselves and they suffer discrimination everyday,\u201d she said. Soni said People Living with HIV (PLHIV) had given a proposal to women and child welfare department four months ago for setting up a home for such children but nothing has been done so far. When contacted, department secretary Dinesh Srivastava said they have received the proposal and it has been sent to Central ministry for approval for setting up two homes for HIV orphans Raipur and Bilaspur. \u201cWe are hopeful to get an approval at the department\u2019s annual meeting scheduled next month,\u201d said Srivastava. As per an annual report of National AIDS Control Organisation (2014-15), number of people living with HIV as on September 2014 were 6,368 in Chhattisgarh. Of these, 3,569 are male and 2,343 are female. The number of male children is 255 and female is 194."

        "body": "LUDHIANA: It seems that the health department's purpose of keeping track of TB patients, facing a HIV risk, has been solved. As the department has started the concept of offering voluntary HIV testing and compulsory counselling to patients, 11 new HIV cases have been identified in the second quarter. Sources said in the second quarter, after a total of 800 TB patients, who never had undergone for HIV testing were checked, and 11 were found HIV positive. The integrated package had been started on April 1 where all the TB patients coming for the sputum tests were given the voluntary counselling on HIV and were motivated to go for the testing at the integrated counselling and testing centres. Till now, the district health department did not have the data regarding the number of TB patients suffering from HIV. While giving the information, one of the officials of the health department said that under this program counselling would be given at the integrated centre, and, if the TB patient agrees to go for the test and turns positive for HIV, then he/she will be given antiretroviral drugs free. At present, more than 500 TB patients are coming only in civil hospital for the sputum tests. On the condition of anonymity, one of the staff members of the ICTC Centre said that mostly people who were suffering from TB were at higher risk of getting the infection but due to the lack of awareness they did not come for the voluntary tests and patients themselves were not aware that they were suffering from HIV. While giving the information, district TB officer Ashish Chawla said that this had been started with the aim to create awareness among the TB patients and to check the incidence among the TB patients as with this it was clear that almost 1% of the patients suffering from TB were suffering from HIV. Dr Chawla added that along with the status of HIV patients, it would be helpful to provide them treatment after checking the patients and would be helpful in deciding the follow-up treatment."

        "body": "KOCHI: Finally, Aids cases in Kerala are showing a turn towards the decline. But health experts in the state are not heaving a sigh of relief as there is a steady increase in the number of youths contracting Aids, posing a threat to the health scene here. A decade ago, around 3,000-4.000 new cases used to be registered in a year. This has now come down to around 1,000. It is estimated that around 40,060 people are living with HIV/Aids in Kerala, gaining a low prevalence status to the state on the HIV epidemic map of the country. But the National Aids Control Organization's (NACO) 2011 annual report shows that 31 percent of the people affected with HIV are young people below the age of 30. In Kerala, nearly half of the total cases are reported among youths, mainly because of their wrong notions of safe sex. Now, the highest number of cases is reported from Palakkad, followed by Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur. Concerned about the increase in the number of cases in Palakkad, the Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) has chosen this district for its major programmes this year, beginning with the state-level inauguration of World Aids Day on Thursday. \"Since Palakkad is a border area, many factors, including the high prevalence of Aids in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu affect the scene here. So we are planning to start new programmes with the help of local bodies,\" says Dr K Shylaja, project director of KSACS. The cases reported among sex workers have also come down during the past years, but now the general population is more at risk because of unsafe sex practices. \"Youths who are more into free sex and migrant labourers who are not aware of the severity of the problem are the new risk groups,\" says Dr Shylaja. Strangely, even when voluntary tests are being done more now, the general awareness about Aids seems not to have filtered down to the grassroots level. \"Strangely, we have not conducted any studies on why Kerala shows a low prevalence now. We also need to analyse why youngsters ignore the fact that prevention of Aids is not all about condom promotion,\" says Joseph Mathew, state president of the Council of People living with HIV/Aids in Kerala (CPK Plus). The coming days will see more awareness programmes for corporate employees, Kudumbasree workers and health staff to bring down the number of cases. Since this year's World Aids Day has the theme 'Getting to zero' focusing on the eradication of new cases, discrimination and deaths, experts are bringing in more effective measures to highlight preventive measures and ensure a healthy life."

There are 22 orphan and HIV-positive students under the care of NGO Spandana, who are schooling here. They play and participate in all school activities along with normal students. Recently, when parents of other students learnt about this, they approached the school authorities and asked them to make separate arrangements for HIV-positive students, and warned that they would not send their children. SDMC president Sunanda Kumbhargoudar called a meeting to discuss the matter on Tuesday. Ward councillor Vidya Mali, Spandana president Mahantesh Mali, Cluster Resource Person (CRP) from the education department Vasant Katti and parents were present.

        "body": "Pune: A 38-year-old HIV-infected woman from the city has been diagnosed with a rare cancer which has only 59 known patients worldwide. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an extremely rare type of cancer involving immune system cells. Its diagnosis corroborates findings of the landmark study conducted by National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) that has underlined an increase in certain cancers which are not commonly seen among people living with HIV/AIDS in India. Known as a non-AIDS defining cancer (NADCs), ALCL can affect mouth, salivary glands, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, eye and brain among other organs. Researchers are trying to find out the reasons for their high growth rate. \"The woman, a homemaker, was brought to me on a wheelchair. She had severe pain in bones and had lost a lot of weight. ALCL is very difficult to diagnose because it is so rare. One needs to have a very high index of suspicion to diagnose this,\" said oncologist Padmaj Kulkarni of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, where the woman is being treated. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma of bone is extremely uncommon and only sporadic case studies are available in literature till date. \"The last case of this disease in an HIV infected patient was reported in \"Proceedings of Baylor University Medical Centre\" in 2015. The Pune woman is perhaps the 60th patient worldwide. It is rare even in non-HIV patients,\" Kulkarni said. Ameet Dravid, infectious diseases and HIV specialist from Pune, has been treating the woman. \"The woman came to me with complaints of fatigue and night sweating, back and neck pain and weight loss of five kg in a month. Her X-ray showed multiple lytic lesions and erosion of the bony areas in ribs while CT scan of chest and abdomen showed multiple osteolytic lesions showing severe bone loss in most vertebrae, ribs, both hips and sacroiliac joints which were suggestive of a cancer.\" Biopsy taken from her pelvic bone showed anaplastic large cell Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (ALCL). \"This cancer is very rare in HIV positive patients. In fact, in our series of 1,261 patients who had HIV with cancer, 30 were diagnosed with cancer. B-cell lymphomas were commonest while the woman is the only patient with ALCL,\" Dravid said. The woman was admitted to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in the second week of December last year for pain control, feeding and other supportive care. Her nuclear medicine imaging (PET-CT) scan was also unique as it showed that only bones were affected with no lymph nodes or any other organ being involved. The patient was put on chemotherapy. \"It was very difficult to give her the right dose of chemotherapy as low dose would not control her cancer while a high dose might lead to death. Her treatment is on and she has, so far, responded very well. She doesn't have severe pain and she comes walking for treatment and is now tolerating full dose of chemotherapy, which is the only treatment available for this type of cancer,\" Kulkarni said. Haematologist Sameer Melinkeri said, \"Patients with HIV infection commonly develop the more common B cell lymphomas. It is distinctly unusual for such patients to develop T cell lymphomas such as ALCL. The treatment for this patient is going to be a challenge since literature is scarce regarding the best line of treatment.\" Oncologist Tushar Patil of Sahyadri Specility hospitals said, \"The most common form of lymphoma in HIV affected patients is 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in late stages when CD 4 (type of white blood cell that fights infection) count drops to very low levels, we usually encounter Burkitt's lymphoma. ALCL in these patients is extremely rare though the management will still be same as ALCL in non-HIV patients. It is necessary to continue anti-HIV treatment along with chemotherapy.\""

Dr Solomon had practised public health for years along with her husband Dr Victor Solomon, who was an eminent cardiologist. Dr Victor Solomon died in 2006. For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save lives, and lost hers to cancer, in three months. \"She was diagnosed with cancer three months ago. She continued her battle till the last minute,\" said a person closely associated with the doctor\u2019s family. She was aged above 70 years and is survived by her son Sunil Suhas Solomon. Dr Solomon, who belonged to the illustrious Gaitonde family, and her colleagues documented the first evidence of HIV infection in India in 1986 when she served as a professor of microbiology at Madras Medical College and Government General Hospital as a professor of microbiology. She also set up the first voluntary testing and counseling centre and an AIDS research group in Chennai. She held prestigious posts in various national organisations that worked for HIV positive people and was the principal investigator of several pioneering HIV research studies. These include the US National Institute of Mental Health's multi-country HIV/STD prevention trial and measuring stigma in health care settings in southern India. Her experience covered a wide range of aspects related to HIV infection, from biomedical to socio-economic. \"She dealt with science in the most honest manner and had a high sense of commitment for completion. We have lost a prolific and erudite scientist,\" said Dr S Sudnararaman, who worked with her in the 80s and 90s."

        "body": "SOLAPUR: Sumana will turn 18 next year, but she looks 10, is four-feet-tall and weighs 30kg. The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is that of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur\u2019s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state\u2019s oldest institution caring for children with HIV, suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India\u2019s 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out. Stunted, depressed, low on hearing: HIV+ kids face fallout despite drugs Sumana looks like a 10-year-old though she\u2019s a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30kg, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a child half her age and she is hearing impaired. At Solapur\u2019s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra\u2019s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana\u2019s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high. AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra. An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. \u201cI get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART . \u201cChildren go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?\u201d said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. \u201cSo when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.\u201d Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child. Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi\u2019s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities. The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014\u2014a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur\u2019s outskirts\u2014as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it\u2019s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. \u201cA regular school wouldn\u2019t understand or probably tolerate it,\u201d Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment. Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition. Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. \u201cThe pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,\u201d said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him \u201cdrowsy and tired\u201d. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV. HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it\u2019s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it\u2019s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. \u201cThese are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,\u201d she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs. National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that \u201cthey live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.\u201d There are side-effects, but \u201cwhat is important is they are alive\u201d. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving. (Names of all patients have been changed)"

        "body": "Maharashtra will soon introduce a new test for HIV in order to reduce transfusion transmitted infections.Called the nucleic acid test (NAT), it is a test that detects HIV within four days of the infection being contracted. The present method to screen HIV has a four-week window period (the time between a person is infected and the virus infection starts showing up in the tests). The decision to introduce NAT came about when health minister Deepak Sawant was reviewing HIV AIDS cases in the state in a meeting with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). The minister was informed that of the 11 lakh donor blood samples tested across the state, more than 2,500 were found to be HIV+. This means that these HIV+ had donated blood during the window period (and probably did not know that they were infected). The minister was also told that NAT test ing is very important to reduce the risk of HIV infection though blood transfusion. To put things in perspective, at least 1,000 people in Maharashtra contracted HIV in the past five years due to blood transfusions. \"It was in January this year that the NAT proposal was discussed with the health minister and he finally pushed the proposal to the Centre,\" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS. Presently all blood banks follow the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guidelines and use fourth generation HIV Elisa testing kits to screen blood for HIV. According to Pardesi, NACO has sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NAT test. Six districts -Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Ahmedanagar -will have NAT centers and around 300 blood banks will be attached to the centers. Blood samples from all over the state will be sent to one of these centers for testing. Currently, only two private hospitals in the city - Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital (Andheri) and PD Hinduja hospital (Mahim) have NAT equipment. While a single ELISA test cost Rs 200, NAT costs Rs 1,000 per test. \"The cost of installing NAT equipment is high. Therefore, it took time to install the facility in state. We will also provide training to the lab technician for the NAT testing,\" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS. Karnataka was the first state in the country to implement the NAT system in all government blood banks. For more stories, follow us on Twitter and Facebook"

Most antiretroviral therapies used to treat HIV are deposited in the liver, lungs and other organs before they reach the brain. \u201cThis allows HIV to lurk unchecked ,\u201d said Nair. This new method could help patients suffering from deseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s , Parkinson\u2019s and epilepsy."

This has led the number of infected thalassemic children to 24. This information was revealed in a status report submitted by CBI to Gujarat high court. This was the fourth report that the probe agency filed in court ever since it was assigned with the investigation on June 27 last year. After going through the report that was submitted in sealed cover, the bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala granted two more months to CBI to probe the issue and come up with another report. The HC handed over the investigation from a Gujarat-cadre IPS officer to CBI, expressing dissatisfaction with the manner the probe was conducted till then. The CBI accordingly lodged a fresh FIR against office bearers of the private blood bank and hospital authorities. While transferring the probe, the judges noticed how former investigator IPS Shobha Bhutada had tried to shield local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo by merely recording his statement, whereas allegations were mainly targeted against the blood bank that was illegally operating from the civil hospital campus. Mashroo looks after this private blood bank. In 2011, 23 thalassemic kids in Junagadh district were found to have contracted HIV. The court transferred the probe to CBI after a PIL was filed, and this was the first CBI probe ordered by Gujarat HC in response to a PIL. Ever since HIV infection was detected among children, five kids have reportedly died."

The ruling from a single judge bench of Justice Madan Tahaliyani came on criminal appeal of Buldhana-based Raju Girnare, currently lodged in Amravati Central Jail. He was accused of kidnapping, outraging the modesty of and raping a 14-year-old girl on May 17, 2009, in Buldhana after luring her with promise of marriage. After a complaint by her father, the police arrested and charge-sheeted him under Sections 363, 366 and 376 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The ad hoc additional sessions judge in Buldhana convicted and sentenced Girnare to seven years' rigorous imprisonment for rape and five years for kidnapping on February 23, 2012. The petitioner approached the high court appealing for lesser punishment under proviso to Section 376(1) of IPC contending he was a HIV positive patient and had two growing children, including a 13-year-old girl, to look after. The court, however, noted that his children were already being looked after by other family members as he was in custody from the date of arrest. Therefore, there is no occasion for the children to suffer. \"As far as the disease of the appellant is concerned, it is most probably invited by himself for which no leniency can be shown. HIV can be treated by regular visits to the hospital or consultation with the medical officer of the prison. Such facilities are provided in the prison where authorities are always mindful of the problems of the prisoners, particularly those who are suffering from severe diseases,\" Justice Tahaliyani observed while upholding Buldhana court's verdict. It was the case of survivor's father that he came in contact with Girnare during delivery of his wife at Buldhana Government Hospital. His daughter was staying with the mother in the ward. He came into contact with the petitioner as latter was also staying in the same hospital to look after one of his relatives was admitted there. On the fateful day, the girl, her father and petitioner had gone to vegetable market together in morning. In the evening, the girl went missing from the hospital along with the petitioner. The accused allegedly took her to his sister's village, detained her overnight and forced her to have sex with him before letting her off. Afterwards, she returned to the hospital and narrated the incident. Medical reports confirmed the rape."

The 63-yearold woman was admitted to the hospital with a fractured femur, for which she needs to undergo surgery. While the son claimed doctors had suspended treatment after learning that she was HIV positive, hospital authorities denied the charge and said the treatment had got prolonged due to other health issues of the woman. The patient, a Beliaghata resident, was admitted to Unit-V of the orthopaedic surgery department on October 5 after she fell down at her home. \u201cAll investigations prior to the surgery were done.

The woman from Banapur area of Khurda district said she and her 28-year-old husband had undergone HIV test in the hospital on April 11. \"While he tested negative, I was found positive. He left me and our daughter in the hospital after that. He is not even attending to my phone calls,\" she said. The woman and her husband, who works as a wall painter in Bangalore, had come to the hospital because of their daughter's illness on April 10. The child had developed intermittent fever and lost weight. Doctors in Capital Hospital suggested an HIV test on her. The integrated counseling and testing centre (ICTC) in the hospital, however, advised the parents to undergo the test since the girl was too small. After the ICTC revealed the results, the man abandoned the mother and the daughter. The girl is recuperating in the pediatric ward while her mother is attending on her. \"I waited for two days but he did not turn up. I called up my mother and brother after that,\" she said. \"I am shocked because he is otherwise a dotting husband and took care of us very well.\" The woman's brother said when he and some relatives went to meet her husband, the man hurled abuses at them. When contacted over phone by TOI, the husband said, \"You must be knowing why I did this? I had to leave.\" Capital Hospital authorities described the development as a social problem. \"It is an unfortunate development. There is need for greater awareness so that people don't shy away from owning up a HIV+ kin,\" said hospital's deputy medical superintendent Dr S N Swain. Family sources said the woman after her delivery in Banapur hospital in November was referred to Khurda district headquarters hospital because of profuse bleeding. There she was transfused with two units of blood, which may be the source of her infection. \"We have raised the issue with the Khurda hospital authorities,\" said Pravasini Pradhan, president of Kalinga Network of Positive People, which works for the welfare of HIV+ persons. Volunteers working for HIV+ said the development is not very unusual as several women if tested positive were facing similar ostracism. \"In this case since the husband is negative and wife positive, the man has tried to escape the situation by shrinking his responsibilities,\" said Ambika Parida, a women's rights educator with Property Ownership and Legal Literacy (POLL), a project working for HIV+ people."

        "body": "NAGPUR: Though the government has floated several welfare schemes and facilities for the benefit of the people suffering from AIDS, most of these facilities do not seep through to the grassroots. Many times, the government representatives themselves are either unaware or not sensitive enough to work for the People Living with HIV (PLHIV). The condition of children living with HIV (CLHIV) is still worse with not many paediatricians versed with care required for these children. These were amongst the few grievances expressed by HIV positive people during the three-day grassroots level advocacy workshop organized by NGO World Vision India. Forty PLHIVs and many other NGOs participated. NGOs working in the field of HIV/AIDS like Sanjeevan, District Level PLHA Network, Eficor, Saathii, CRTDP, IID, Women Resource Center, Sharansthan, National Council of Churches in India also participated. \"The workshop aimed to strengthen the advocacy capacity of communities to address the issues faced by women and children living with HIV in different areas of the district. We wanted the PLHIVs to get the attention they deserve from the policymakers, the media, and society,\" said Joe George, programme officer of World Vision Nagpur. The participants discussed several practical difficulties faced by them every day. \"There are no facilities for AIDS patients at village level. With the government deciding to link us with the NRHM workers, this may change. For children suffering from the disease, it would make a huge difference if government provided them nutrition,\" said Anil Dalve, president of Network for PLHIV in Maharashtra. \"The number of ART centres in the state is insufficient if we consider the fact that Maharashtra has 14% of the Indians with the disease. All these people will soon require second line treatment too. I hope the government plans to open more centres,\" said Dalve. Daisy David, a PLHIV who now works as an advocacy associate, believes the government has good structure but what they lack is implementation and monitoring. \"When the district programme officers for AIDS speak to the NGOs working at the grassroots, they discuss projects and funds but rarely issues. They can't travel to all the villages under their jurisdiction and are unaware of the shortcomings in medical services in many of them,\" she said. If these authorities could guide and help the PLHIVs, things could improve a lot, she said. BOX: COMMON STIGMAS IN HOSPITALS * Discrimination while conducting any diagnostic process *Operations are delayed, even the emergency ones including appendicitis, heart surgery *Even government hospitals refuse to admit pregnant women or conduct deliveries * Private hospitals keep referring patients to government hospitals OTHER PROBLEMS *Block level PLHIV are not having proper information on welfare schemes *Viral load is not done in Nagpur district NEEDS OF THE POSITIVE PEOPLE *Community Care Centre services *Funeral support *Care home for children SUGGESTION *Hospitals should have a separate ward for positive patients where the staff is well trained as well as free of prejudices *Platform be given to the NGOs who are not recipient of MSACS funds. *Coordination of NGOs working in the HIV sector to be initiated by the SACS/NACO *Information on updated government's welfare schemes and job opportunities be given to the stakeholders to improve the quality lifestyle *Establishment and functioning of block level link ART centers *Rural Hospitals should be equipped proper infrastructure, human resources to handle the PLHAs' delivery cases *Capacity building initiatives for PLHIVs * Proper care be given to Children living with HIV by providing paediatric doctors in ART centers, nutrition support and children education support. ends"

HIV spreads through sexual contact, unsafe blood transfusion or by sharing needles. While unprotected sexual contact has for long been the main cause of the HIV AIDS epidemic, what is surprising this time around is that the all-India average is lower. \u201cCompared to Mumbai's 91%, the all-India figure is 80%,\u201c added Dr Acharya. The Mumbai AIDS control figures for 2015-16 show that among the remaining cases, 5.7% got infected from infected mother to child, 0.2% people were infected due to unsafe blood and 0.5% through infected needles or syringes. The government has taken several steps to break the HIV transmission chain. \u201cThere is such awareness about unsafe needles that this transmission chain is almost negligible,\u201c said Eldred Tellis from NGO Sankalp. He said that while there were 15,000 drug-injectors in Mumbai in 2,000, the number fell to 8,000 in 2008 and stood around 1,000 this year. The new three-drug regimen started two years back to prevent mother-to-child transmission too has yielded results."

Forty women from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Maharashtra participated in the two-day western regional meet held in the city to discuss and plan the fourth phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP IV). The meet concluded on Tuesday. \"We no longer want to be seen as recipients, but as designers and managers of health programmes,\" Sunita from Gujarat said. The consultations were initiated by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) that spearheads the National AIDS Control Programmes that are tagged on to the NACP IV design. It involves critical areas that communities and civil society want to get incorporated. \"The meeting focused on identifying the gaps in NACP III and identifying priority and critical areas that matter for the community which need to be addressed in NACP IV,\" Meena Sheshu, member of the Indian Network of Sex Workers (INSW), said. The group had hosted the meet. The community looked into the rights, entitlements and treatment issues in the NACO programmes. \"The group wanted issues related to dignity, equality and livelihood be included and prioritised in the health framework,\" Sheshu said. The recommendations made will be shared with NACO, she added. \"Our problems are best known to us and hence we want to be included in the planning process. Our voices should be heard,\" said Puja, a peer educator from Madhya Pradesh. The community was concerned about repeated acts of stigma and discrimination and violence against them by the police. \"When one of us was taken to the hospital, the officials put up a board identifying her as 'High Risk Group' on her bed. Other patients took offence against the woman. We fought with the hospital officials and the doctors. It is important that the behaviour of those in the healthcare sector changes. They must be sensitised,\" Laxmi, a sex worker from Gujarat, said. Another peer educator from Goa suggested that the new framework address raids by police and unlawful arrests of sex workers. \"We are not against the law. We oppose trafficking of minors and forced prostitution. Police action against the community must be checked by the government as it drives the community underground and out of the HIV programme,\" she said. The recommendations made by community groups will be treated as national recommendations. They will suggest the framework of NACP IV for the communities and civil society. The suggestions will be presented to Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on June 19 and later to NACO."

I realized he had passed away in sleep. Since it was late in the night, all I could do was wait for dawn so that I could inform neighbours,\" Barnali said. When neighbours learnt about Nil Madhab's death, they began gathering before his house, not to extend help, but confabulate on what to do. Soon, a 1,200-strong mob gathered with some demanding Nil Madhab's body be taken away from the village as it was \"contaminated\". \"I sought their help.

On Saturday, two HIV positive women narrated their sordid tales in a media workshop organized by the Rajasthan Network for People Living With HIV/AIDS (RNP+) in Jaipur. They said that the attitude of their inlaws changed when they came to know that they were detected HIV positive. One of them, Manju, said: \"The brother of my husband badly behaved with me when my husband died of AIDS. They expelled me from the house.\" Manju's inlaws live in Tonk district. She has two daughters - one is 11-years-old and the other is 8-years-old. Both of them were tested HIV negative. Another woman, Sita from Dholpur, had the same story to tell. She said her husband thrashed him badly when he came to know that she is infected with HIV virus. She was also expelled from the house along with her 7-year-old HIV positive daughter. The RNP+ (women's wing) president Mona said, \"These are not the only two HIV positive women who are expelled by their inlaws. There are so many such cases which have come to light in the past.\" She said that such women have to face criticism and they also get stigmatized. \"If the husband and wife both are HIV positive and wife gets tested positive for HIV before husband, then she has to face a lot of criticism and also her husband put a blot on her character. There are so many such cases,\" Mona said. \"The state government can do a lot for such women and their children. We have already submitted a draft of policy to the state government last year on December 1. But, the government has not taken it up. The main points of the policy was single window approach for integrated health services, insurance, legal support, access to economic resources, right to property, right to livelihood, nutrition and educational benefits,\" programme manager, John Samuels, RNP+ said. He alleged that the government has not even constituted a committee to look into the draft policy. Now the organization has decided to take out a rally on children's day on November 14 in support of the policy. They claimed that this would benefit around 25,000 persons and over 80,000 families affected by HIV in the state."

Raphael Pinto was found drunk on a road in Margao and was shifted to the Hospicio hospital in a 108 ambulance. Shortly later, on November 1, he was admitted to the orthopaedic ward of the Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim, where he was diagnosed with fracture of the spinal cord and neurological deficit. Pinto died on November 3. Registered as a medico-legal case, the Margao police were asked to investigate the death and hand the body over to relatives. \"Based on the address provided by the victim at GMC we checked the electoral rolls in South Goa and tried to trace his relatives, but the effort was in vain,\" said a senior police official. The police also announced Pinto's death in churches in Colva and Margao requesting relatives to claim the body. \"No one has responded,\" the official added. Sources said that as per procedure when relatives fail to claim a body police can cremate the body. But the police are unable to do this in Pinto's case as they have not got a no-objection certificate from forensic doctors at GMC. \"For the NOC the police have to state that they are not conducting any further inquiry and therefore a postmortem need not be conducted,\" said sources. With no move to get an NOC, forensic doctors have agreed to conduct a postmortem, provided the police get a cause-of-death certificate from the orthopaedic ward. Police claim they have written to the doctor treating Pinto at GMC. \"The doctor has informed us in writing that the certificate can be given only after a postmortem. Forensic doctors won't conduct the postmortem till Pinto's relatives are traced,\" said police. Says Mahesh Govekar of NGO Zindagi-Goa: \"We are celebrating World AIDS Day on Thursday and talking about rights of HIV positive people. But even today politics is being played by police and doctors over the issue of an HIV positive person's body. If the police can't trace Pinto's relatives they could at least contact NGOs working with HIV positive persons and ensure that the body is cremated.\" (Name of HIV positive person changed to protect identity)"

Thirty HIV-affected persons from the district will be trained in the manufacture of detergent soaps, soap powder, phenyl, paper covers, office files, palm-craft and rearing nursery plants. The 10-day training organised by the Women's Project, is being conducted by experts from the Rural Development and Self Employment Trust (RUDSET). Inaugurating the training session, district collector Anshul Mishra said that it was an initiative to rehabilitate persons affected with HIV in the district. and that they should use the training effectively to learn the skills. Sending out a strong message to the public, the collector insisted that AIDS is not a communicable disease and hence the public need not be afraid to procure goods manufactured by them. \"People affected by HIV should not feel discouraged. They can lead a normal and healthy life through regular treatment and can involve themselves in self-employment trades like anyone,\" he said. R Ganesan, joint director/project officer, Women's Project said the training would consist of more practical sessions. \"The participants will master the various skills in the 10-day training. We will then put them into groups based on their interest of trade. Along with the training, we will arrange bank loans through the District Lead Bank and also allot shops in Poomalai Complex for them. We will also utilise the van in the Women's Project to promote the mobile sales unit,\" he said. The district administration had held a preliminary meeting about the training on July 27, where 60 HIV- affected persons had participated. They were briefed on the project and 30 of them registered for the training, Ganesan said."

        "body": "CHENNAI: It was while working as a lab technician in Oman 18 years ago that Daisy David tested HIV positive. She was later sent back to India with a \u2018contagious disease\u2019 tag on her visa. Daisy has been swimming against the flow since then, working with many NGOs in Tamil Nadu. TOI is naming Daisy since she wanted to be identified. When the recent flood wreaked havoc with the lives of many in the city, Daisy got an opportunity to return to her old job which she had to quit after testing HIV positive. She tested blood samples of flood-affected people in the medical camps organised by an NGO in many parts of the city. Back in 1997, after the blood bank of the hospital where Daisy worked ran out of stock during an emergency operation, the staff was requested to donate blood. The donors were tested and Daisy\u2019s blood turned out to be HIV positive. \u201cI was clueless about how I got infected until I saw my husband\u2019s medical report at our home in Vellore. He was sick. And one day he told me that he was HIV positive. It was the most shocking moment in my life,\u201d she said. Worse, Daisy\u2019s husband even spoiled her plan to return to Oman in many ways. He threatened her and tore her passport. But Daisy managed to go back to Oman with a new passport. Her husband reacted furiously by writing to the management of the hospital where she worked. The management asked her to undergo one more test, and unfortunately that too turned out to be positive. As she was getting ready for her return, she got a telegram. \u201cIt said my husband was no more, but it was too late. I had to leave the place with a \u2018contagious disease\u2019 tag on my visa. I was made to sit inside the aircraft with three rows in front of and behind me kept vacant,\u201d Daisy said. Back home, life has finally taken a positive turn for Daisy. \u201cHIV is a gift from God. I take it positively. I am happy that I could save people during this natural calamity,\u201d she said."

        "body": "December 1 is World Aids Day. Medical expert Sandeep Budhiraja says we can all stay AIDS-free if we follow safe sex practices and be monogamous. HIV stands for the human immunodeficiency virus. After getting into the body, the virus kills or damages cells of the immune system . The body keeps up by making new cells or trying to contain the virus, but eventually HIV wins and destroysthe body\u2019s ability to fight infections and cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . It is caused by HIV and occurs when the virus destroys so much of the body\u2019s defences that immune-cell counts fall to life-threatening levels. India has an HIV/AIDS population of around 1.6 million. However, the United Nations 2011 AIDS report says there has been a 50% decline in the number of new HIV infections in the last 10 years in India. HIV/AIDS transmission HIV enters the body usually by injecting infected cells or semen. HIV infection is usually spread by having sex. Although intercourse is the primary risk factor , oral sex transmission is possible. HIV frequently spreads among injection-drug users who share syringes. Women can transmit HIV to their babies during pregnancy or birth or through breastfeeding. People who already have a sexually transmitted infection are more likely to acquire HIV infection during sex with an infected partner. The virus does not spread through casual contact such as preparing food, sharing towels and bedding, or via swimming pools, telephones, or toilet seats. HIV/AIDS symptoms People with HIV often do not know they are infected. Many people do not develop symptoms after they first get infected, but others have a history of a flulike illness within several days to weeks after exposure to the virus . Early HIV symptoms could include fever, headache, tiredness , and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. These symptoms usually disappear within a few weeks. After that, the person feels normal and has no symptoms \u2014 a phase that could last for years. When to take a test If you have engaged in unprotected sex outside a mutually monogamous relationship or shared needles using drugs, take an HIV test. Early detection and treatment slows the growth of HIV. If you are pregnant and infected with HIV, you may be able to reduce the risk to your unborn child by getting treatment early."

        "body": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The influx of migrant labourers in the state has made the Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) think of boarding the public transport system to spread awareness on HIV. To begin with, 150 buses operated both by the government and private players in Palakkad, Thrissur and Pathanamthitta districts would run the campaign against HIV. The KSACS selected the three districts to rollout the first phase of the awareness drive due to the high prevalence of HIV. \"This is the first time we would be engaging the public transport system to spread the message against HIV,'' said a KSACS official. The 150 buses would be carrying messages by actor Mohanlal, the brand ambassador of the society. \"The messages will be in different languages so it will help educate people from outside the state,'' said the official. He added that the society would enter into a six-month contract with bus operators in the three districts, and would be extended after reviewing its impact. The KSACS would later extend the campaign in phases to other districts. A sexual health intervention project being carried out in seven districts, and the preliminary findings have revealed high-risk groups among migrant labourers. As many as 11 cases were found positive in Kasaragod alone a year ago. The finding acted as an eye-opener and authorities have been mulling over conducting an exhaustive study and screening of migrants to bring out the real picture. \"The migrants' level of awareness should be improved. We are finding it difficult to reach out to them due to language barriers. Hence we hope that this new mode of campaign could bridge the gap,'' said the official. The KSACS has also initiated talks with the southern railway to replicate the same on trains plying in the state. The society has already been running a campaign on blood donation on trains. Besides buses and trains, the KSACS also has plans to use government establishments in the state to spread awareness on HIV."

        "body": "BHOPAL: The risk of HIV infection through used needles is a clear and present danger in rural Madhya Pradesh, as nearly 50% of quacks operating in villages have no formal training and zero awareness on the virus. Reports of a quack in Uttar Pradesh infecting 58 people with HIV by using infected needles have shaken the MP government into the need to monitor quacks, who roam around the hinterland posing as doctors. The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds. What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts \u2014 sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks. \u201cWe target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday,\u201d said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. \u201cCrackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration,\u201d he added. However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP. The number of HIV/AIDS patients in MP is 0.09% of the population \u2014 less than national adult prevalence of 0.27% (2013). In 2016, NACO reported 44,427 AIDS patients in MP. Quacks exploit the lacunae in healthcare in MP. The state has about 4,500 MBBS doctors for the health department whereas WHO estimates say there is a need for at least 15,000 more."

Recent data released by the World Health Organization show HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death globally in women 15 to 44 years old. In Africa, HIV/AIDS is the single most important cause of disease for a wider range of women, aged 15-59.

But after the test last week, they have started touching me again,\u201d said Hadibandhu Sahoo, who has been undergoing treatment for a broken spine. Sahoo had tested HIV positive in April 2011 at Swami Vivekanad National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research, an institute of the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment in Cuttack district. Sahoo, who is from Ghantapada village in Angul district, used to work as a security guard in a biscuit manufacturing company in Gujarat\u2018s Bhuj. He had broken his spine during the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and underwent a series of treatment at various health centres. His spine, however, refused to heal and he was finally admitted to the Vivekanad National Institute for treatment from April to June 2011, where he was diagnosed HIV positive. \u201cI was discharged from the hospital in August and started a paan shop in Talcher with the help of the local MLA. However, people who knew my HIV status would avoid the shop,\u201d he said. The 50-year-old wheelchair-bound man had to be admitted to Capital Hospital when he injured his back again recently after he slipped and fell while taking bath. In a fresh test conducted at the Integrated Counelling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Capital Hospital, Sahoo was found to be HIV negative last week. \u201cThe recent fall was a blessing in disguise for me. I have got a new lease of life after the fresh diagnosis. I had started cursing my life earlier,\u201d said Sahoo , adding, \u201cNow finally I am being treated as a normal person.\u201d When contacted, the hospitals defended the test reports. \u201cWe rely on the rapid test kits supplied by National AIDS Control Organisation, which has a margin of error,\u201d said R N Mohanty, director in-charge of Vivekanad National Institute. Capital Hospital authorities said the ICTC test is a confirmatory test. \u201cI can\u2019t comment about test done elsewhere but ICTC tests are regarded confirmatory. We will, however , look into the matter if something may have gone wrong,\u201d said Capital Hospital spokesperson Dr S N Swain.

He added that migrant labourers, truck drivers and MSM (men having sex with men) have been given free condoms for safe sex. These migrants are mainly responsible for spread of HIV infection in the district. A survey has shown that migrants working at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who keep moving from one state to another in search of work) are responsible for the spread of the deadly disease. Officials have also identified high-risk groups like sex workers and intravenous drug users who would be covered under the programme to restrict the spread of the virus."

This August 15, Kripa Foundation, which works with recovering addicts, will celebrate its 31st Founders Day and it's been over 25 years since they started a branch in Goa at Anjuna. Pereira warns that because of this party culture, permissive sexual behaviour, specially among women, has also increased and Goa is sitting on a HIV time-bomb. \"Unfortunately Goan society has a false sense of status. They're into denial that they have any problem. They're so scared of shame that they will never admit that they're alcoholics or drug addicts. They would like to think that only the poor sections of society suffer from alcoholism or drug addiction,\" Pereira says. \"Earlier the flower children were our biggest inmates. They're our biggest supporters now,\" he informs. A certified Iyengar yoga instructor, Pereira advocates what he calls 'secular meditation' to bring about body, mind, spirit unity. \"Then your recovery process becomes much more authentic, because it bypasses your ego,\" he says, adding, \"without the grace of God you cannot do anything.\" He also strongly feels that liquor tycoons like Vijay Mallya should set aside a portion of their profits to fund organizations which help alcohol addicts to recover. \"They're turning so many people into alcoholics. I'm not suggesting prohibition or anything. But I feel they should put a certain portion of their profits to lend a helping hand to those who wish to stop drinking,\" says Pereira."

With his previous experience as chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, reputedly among the most productive multinational research organizations working on HIV pathogenesis and therapy, Schooley was an important contributor to the two-day ART Symposium in the city organized by YRG Care over the weekend to discuss cutting-edge technology in the field. Speaking to TOI on Sunday about new scientific advances in the field, Schooley said, \"There are a host of approaches being adopted by researchers worldwide to try and eradicate HIV however the approaches using either enzymes or RNA to remove infected cells are ultimately the most hopeful and will be the least disruptive for the patient. Paula Cannon, a researcher from California, for instance, has been working on ways to identify HIV-infected cells called CD4 cells (so called because they have a molecule on the surface called CD4) which is a gateway for the virus. These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through. Now, she has created a way for the second molecule to be changed so that they virus cannot recognize it. In this approach, the virus stays outside the cell.\" Elaborating on Cannon's research, he said she had been able to demonstrate it successfully in mice. \"The next step will be to take people with HIV infection who have lymphoma and so, would need a bone marrow transplant for their tumours. She would treat the stem cells and hopefully the bone marrow so grafted would afford the patients' cells protection from HIV,\" Schooley said. Pointing out that this was an experiment that had to be done, he cited the example of a similar case but with a natural modification of the CCR5 molecule being reported in the New York Journal of Medicine about 18 months ago. \"After the HIV-infected individual underwent a bone marrow transplant from such a donor, no one could demonstrate the presence of HIV in the patient. So, there is certainly some preliminary support for her research,\" he said. Commenting on India's research potential, Schooley said that biotechnology was growing at an excellent pace in the country. \"There is some state of the art research work being carried out by YRG Care and some fantastically sophisticated research at National Aids Research Institute, Pune. In fact, the component sites that we have in Chennai and Pune are among the most productive. We are carrying out trials on the best drugs to use for HIV infections, treating people with drug failure and drug resistance and treating people suffering from HIV and Tuberculosis at the same time. There is a lot of important work being carried out over here. India is one of the best places for research activity worldwide,\" he added."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: It might come as a shock but Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) figures have revealed that there are 340 HIV positive prisoners in Tihar jail, South Asia\u2019s biggest prison. The statistics show that most of the prisoners among these 340 HIV positive prisoners are intravenous drug users. These prisoners are getting free treatment from jail authorities under the de-addition programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment). Jail sources said that prisoners did not know about their HIV status earlier and when they came to know about such programme in Tihar, they joined the centre. Officials say six to eight percent population of Tihar is HIV positive, but it is a fluctuating figure. \u201cPresently, there are 11,800 prisoners in Tihar and this number keeps on fluctuating. So, HIV positive prisoners\u2019 status is also variable because people come and go and they get treatment while being lodged here. All those at the centre have benefited,\u201d said Sunil Gupta, Tihar spokesperson. In the last three years, around 5,700 prisoners, who have taken drugs at least once in life, have undergone tests at this centre. Before June 2008 Tihar jail had no mechanism to identify the HIV positive inmates and whenever any government agency of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) asked the authorities, a rough figure was provided. In June 2008, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre was opened at Tihar with the help of NACO. Sunil Gupta said that they have been able to identify such large number of HIV positive prisoners inside only through ICTC and they all were affected with it before they came here. Officials said that out of 340 prisoners, 210 are intravenous drug users who have once in their life used injections to consume drugs and they have been repeat offenders in drug abuse. He added that medicines under the treatment of HIV positive are very costly and jail authorities provide these medicines for free to the affected inmates apart from counseling. Earlier, authorities used to send the suspected HIV positive prisoners to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital for treatment but ICTC is located in jail itself with dedicated counselors. The centre provides treatment with the help of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), NGOs and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Gupta said they are providing this treatment to all identified HIV positive inmates so that they don\u2019t spread this disease when they are released on bail.

WVI, a Christian humanitarian organization working to bring about changes in the lives of children, families and communities living in poverty, said such people have a very alarming prevalence of Hep-C co-infection with HIV. It said non-prevalence of specific components for women and children till date in the National AIDS Control programme were raised and discussed as a major challenge. WVI's advocacy associate Daisy David added that the rate of Hep-C co-infection with HIV is more than 90 per cent in the northeastern states. During an interactive session with PLHIV and reporters held in Imphal on Wednesday, David said, \"People Living with AIDS are dying of liver complications caused by this co-infection and the side effects of ART. This needs to be addressed by the state offering free PCR testing and treatment for Hep-C co-infection.\" The PLHIV activists, during the session, urged the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) to remove the second line ART eligibility procedure from the control of state AIDS clinical expert panel. tnnThey also requested the government to immediately phase out Stavudine (d4T) from the first line regimen and include (TDF) instead in tune with the WHO recommendations. Both WVI and PLHIV batted for children and women-specific diagnosis and easy access to quality care, support and treatment under various social schemes of the government."

While foreign funds may not be an obstacle, experts say that the community may feel inhibited in accessing interventions in the face of unfriendly public service departments. The health ministry data shows that outreach programmes have helped bring down HIV prevalence in high-risk communities like transgender (TG), men having sex with men (MSM) among others. HIV prevalence for transgender has come down from 42.21% in 2006 to 8.82% in 2011, while for MSM the number has declined from 8.74% to 4.43%. The targeted intervention for high risk communities are priority of the Rs 8632.77 crore National AIDS Control Programme Phase-IV approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) in October. The stated objective of NACP IV is to reduce new infections by 50% and intensify and consolidate prevention services with a focus on high-risk groups and vulnerable population and the general population. According to NGO Humsafar Trust, which is active in outreach programmes for the LGBT community, about 7.5 lakh people are being reached through health ministry initiative. \u201cThe government\u2019s programme has brought down HIV prevalence by 57% in high-risk groups. But now we have gone 20 years behind. Our outreach workers had the blanket of the high court order when they went out for awareness generation and interventions. Now, they will be harassed,\u2019\u2019 Vivek Anand from Mumbai based Humsafar Trust said. Naz Foundation executive director Anjali Gopalan said access to health and educational facilities were bound to be impacted adversely. According to a World Bank report, while India is increasing the coverage of targeted interventions for the most at risk populations, it will be critical to sustain these efforts and expand more rapidly in those areas and among those population groups, which are lagging behind and hard to reach; most importantly, comprehensive harm reduction programs among injecting drug users, and safe sex among men having sex with men."

According to health experts, the girl probably was HIV+, which takes time to develop into AIDS. Police said Saira's pimp, Manohar Lal Gupta, a resident of Sector 56, Chandigarh, told them that she had AIDS. Saira worked in the city under the name of Poonam. Police said Gupta knew that Saira could spread infection and still sent her to his customers, which is also a crime. Police are adding Section 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC to Gupta's FIR. Police caught Gupta when he, alongwith two of his friends, Payal and Rajan, were going to dump the girl's body. Saira was murdered at Rajan's place in Sector 10, Panchkula, when she had a heated argument with Gupta over a financial dispute. In the course of that argument, Gupta, Rajan and Payal smothered Saira to death, which was revealed in the postmortem examination conducted at the general hospital in Sector 6.Manohar Lal Gupta, Rajan and Payal were booked under the Section 302 (Punishment for murder), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. No one claimed Saira's body and police cremated the body with the help of an NGO. Police are also interrogating Gupta in the case of murder of a girl, whose naked body was found from the jungles near Saha. Her face was disfigured and no one claimed the body. The case is unsolved so far. Meanwhile, police are asking hospitality service providers in the city not to allow persons involved in the flesh trade to stay in their establishment, failing which strict action will be taken against them. Ambala-Panchkula commissioner of police OP Singh said, \"We will ask all the hospitality service providers in the city to take care of themselves from flesh traders. Gupta is our suspect in the unsolved murder case of Saha where the girl was found naked and no one turned up to claim her body. We are re-examining such cases where young girls bod\u00edes were found and which are not solved till now.\""

Sources said the family members asked the hospital authorities to arrange for the last rites of the body at their level. \"At that time, we threatened with filing a police case and an enquiry which made them afraid and they took away the body for funeral last evening,\" a doctor said. Sources said the family member cremated the body on their own without informing about the death to their relatives. \"It is the stigma in society even after the awareness program run by government.

        "body": "Nagpur: In the last seven years, the rate of new HIV-positive cases in the state has declined by about 42%. As far as mortality due to HIV is concerned, it has declined threefold in last 13 years. The facts were revealed by Dr Pramod Deoraj, an official from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1. Deoraj said, \u201cThe high rates of positive cases and deaths in the past were because earlier we had fewer ART centres, less medicine stock and not every HIV positive patient received free drugs from government due to criteria called CD4.\u201d An official notification on May 5 this year made it possible to \u201ctreat all\u201d living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count (a test that measures the strength of one\u2019s immune system). It has further contributed to decline of new cases. Deoraj said, \u201cWithin the state there were about 23,000 HIV+ve patients who couldn\u2019t get the treatment because of this criteria. With the new guidelines, the government has CD4 clause and we are having a good start. In the last six months we have reached out to over 15,000 patients through ART centres and have been able to begin treatment of about 8000.\u201d Deoraj said, \u201cIn 2010, we used to record about 52,000 new HIV positive cases every year. Last year, the figure fell to 22,000. We have observed that the number is falling by about 1000 to 1200 every year. In 2004 the death rate for HIV positive patients used to be 15% and that has fallen to 5% now.\u201d The state government has total 73 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres where free drugs are given. Three centres in Nagpur district are in the medicine department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) and another at a public health facility in Kamptee. Officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Tanuja Fale said, \u201cIn the district, we also have 21 Integrated Counselling and Testing Center (ICTC) where patients are tested for HIV, counselled and connected with ARTs. In 2015, the district received a mobile van to perform as ICTC in remote areas. Last year, we received another van from the collector.\u201d An RTI query by activist Abhay Kolarkar revealed the ART record of GMCH between the year 2014 and 2016. There is a consistent decline in positive cases here too. The number of deaths came drastically down from 50 to 15 in 2015 but again rose to 30 in 2016."

        "body": "UNITED NATIONS: India saw a major reduction in the number of new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and people living with HIV from 2010 to 2017 on the back of sustained and focussed efforts, according to a UN report which warned that the epidemic was growing in Pakistan. The Joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response. Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017. The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines. In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said. India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said. Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said. The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work. It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work. Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade. The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids. Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said. Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a \"sterling example\" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments. UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point. At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition. \"We are sounding the alarm\", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. \"Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,\" Sidibe said. Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted. Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020. In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said. The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming. Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs. \"The right to health for all is non-negotiable,\" said Sidibe. \"Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,\" Sidibe added."

On Saturday, a team of the health department started its inquiry at the Mangaldai Civil Hospital. The team will submit its report within 72 hours. Residents of Mangaldoi staged a blockade on NH-52 against the state health department and disrupted traffic for several hours. Security forces resorted to lathi charge to clear the highway.

        "body": "CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to the Punjab government, and DGP (prisons) on a plea seeking court-monitored probe into spread of HIV virus among prisoners in Punjab jails. A division bench of the HC headed by Justice Surya Kant has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Karanveer Thamman of Banur in Rajpura tehsil of Patiala district. Referring to some media reports, the petitioner has stated in the PIL that at least 1,630 inmates in nine central jails in Punjab have tested positive for HIV. Modern Jail, Fridkot, has the highest number of 439 HIV positive inmates, while Bathinda has 30, Ferozepur 322, Amritsar 299, Kapurthala 210, Ludhiana 137, Patiala 75, Hoshiarpur 63 and Gurdaspur 55. According to the petitioner, spread of HIV positive disease among jail inmates is caused due to sharing of syringes (used for taking drugs) and through sexual contact. The jail authorities avoid their responsibility by contending that medical examination of persons is not done before lodging them into Jails. Thus, the high incidence of HIV positive cases amongst jail inmates is taking place with connivance of jail officials, and an independent probe should be conducted by a high powered team of retired and honest police officers, advocates and retired judges, the petitioner argued. He added that such team would bring out the true reasons for spread of HIV positive cases among jail inmates. It was further argued that the measures suggested by such a team will go a long way in preventing HIV positive from spreading its wings in jails. The counsel also pleaded that conducting of medical examination and maintaining of records of such medical examination of persons before lodging them into jail, would prevent spread of this dreadful disease further, and conducting of periodical examination of jail inmates would help fixing responsibility of jail officials, if such a person (who did not test positive for HIV) is later found to be inflicted with the virus. The matter would now come up for hearing on March 12."

An AIDS patient herself for seven years, she was tired of the disease and committed suicide by setting herself ablaze on September 2. Instead of standing by him in this difficult time, Prajapati's community slapped a fine of Rs 1.11 lakh on him. Prajapati, who earns Rs 150 a day by working as a labourer at a food eatery, was forced to borrow money and sell ornaments of his wife to pay the fine. \"I was told that since my wife committed suicide, I should pay a fine of Rs 1.11 lakh. I am a very poor person so had to bow down to the community leaders' demands,\" Prajapati, who belongs to Gurjar Kadiya-Kumbhar Prajapati community, told TOI. \"I don't know why I was fined. I have not committed any crime. I have borrowed money and sold ornaments to pay the fine,\" said Prajapati, who paid the money on Friday. Prajapati spend most of his earnings on medication. It is learnt that his wife's brother and other relatives have taken away a huge chunk of this fine. When TOI contacted Mahadev Prajapati, his brother-in-law, he denied even knowing Prajapati. Prajapati, however, has got support from his neighbours, who approached deputy superintendent police, Imtiaz Sheikh. \"We can only look into the matter if Prajapati comes to meet us personally,\" Sheikh told TOI. Prajapati and his wife belong to Abhepara village of Banaskantha district's Vav taluka."

        "body": "JAIPUR: On World Aids Day, Rajasthan got a jolt when it was ranked sixth among states with high HIV prevalence. One out of every 200 pregnant women in the state tested positive for HIV in 2010-11. Further, Rajasthan figures in the category of highly vulnerable and high-priority state due to large migration of people to other cities for jobs. The alarming figures were reported in the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11 report, released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday. The HIV prevalence in the age group of 15-49 years in the state has increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.49% in 2010-11, the report stated. While the national figures registered a dip of 0.27% for the same time frame, in Rajasthan the number of cases shot up by 0.30%. At the antenatal clinics, the HIV prevalence in Rajasthan is higher than neighbouring state Gujarat, which traditionally has a high number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV every year. According to the report, one out of 200 pregnant women tested positive for HIV in 2010-11 against one in 500 in 2008-09. The figures present a scary picture as the HIV prevalence among pregnant women has increased by more than two times. A large number of people also migrate to other big cities that have a high HIV prevalence which puts the state in the highly vulnerable category. People go to work in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh which have high HIV prevalence, a health department official said. \"A large number of truckers pass through the state who are potential carriers of the HIV virus,\" another official said citing it as one of the reasons for high number of HIV positive cases in the state. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) have stepped up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV virus and has decided to extent testing facilities to the block level. A health department official, however, said the HSS figures are provisional. RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence has not increased as per the figures collected from 182 existing Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC). At the ICTC, the RSACS officials conduct counseling and conduct HIV voluntary testing."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: In a pioneering research, scientists claim to have identified a protein that can knock out HIV, which causes AIDS, by starving it of raw materials it needs to reproduce . An international team, led by the NYU Langone Medical Center, says its research has in fact revealed a mechanism by which the immune system tries to halt spread of HIV, and harnessing this mechanism may pave the way for therapeutic research aimed at slowing the virus' progression to AIDS. \u201cA lot of research on viruses , especially HIV, is aimed at trying to understand what the body\u2019s mechanisms of resistance are and then to understand how the virus has gotten around these mechanisms,\u201d said team member Nathaniel R Landau in the \u2018Nature Immunology\u2019 journal. The research focused on a protein called SAMHD1. Recent studies have found that immune cells, called dendritic cells, containing the protein are resistant to infection by HIV. But it was not clear till now how it works to protect these cells. Now, Landau and his colleagues are able to provide an answer: When a virus, like HIV, infects a cell, it hijacks the cell\u2019s molecular material to replicate. That molecular material is in the form of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for DNA. Once the virus replicates, the resulting DNA molecule contains all the genes of the virus and instructs the cell to make more virus. The team found that SAMHD1 protects the cell from viruses by destroying the pool of dNTPs, leaving the virus without any building blocks to make its genetic information."

He has also completed the 45-day rope climbing training at Badami under the General Thimmaiah National Adventure and Sports Academy. Over the past three years, Akshay has been involved in adventure activities. He was also part of the rescue operations in the Uttarakhand tragedy a few months ago. The dream of climbing the Everest took shape when he met two mountaineers, Arjun Vajpayee and Krishna, during these rescue operations. These two youths had successfully climbed the Everest. The Everest climb is a costly %affair. Deshpande needs around %Rs 30 lakh for it. \"I'm looking for sponsors and hoping crowdfunding and public donations will help me on my mission,\" he told TOI."

        "body": "Mumbai: Deaths due to AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) have increased significantly in the city over the last three years, according to data available with the central health ministry\u2019s Health Management Information System. While 27 HIV-positive people died in Mumbai in 2015-16, the number rose to 72 in 2016-17 and further to 116 in 2017-18, showed the data. \u201cThere has been a 62% increase in deaths due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the last one year alone,\u201d said RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who compiled the data. Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into a chronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years. In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn\u2019t want to be identified, said, \u201cDeaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.\u201d Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs. \u201cHowever, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the government-run programme. The poor cannot afford to buy them,\u201d the doctor added. However, city authorities in charge of the HIV/AIDS control programme said there is a simple explanation for the increase: A sharper public health programme that has managed to track more patients. Dr Shrikala Acharya of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) said the organization had carried out intensive loss-to-follow-up drives as per central government directives to track patients who were lost to follow-up. \u201cThis drive helped us update the actual number of deaths. It could also be the reason for the increase in reported deaths,\u201d she said, adding that the rise isn\u2019t necessarily an actual increase in the number of deaths. Incidentally, the HMIS data shows that the number of AIDS deaths has been steadily decreasing across Maharashtra. From 1,426 deaths in 2015-16, the figure fell to 1,390 in the following year and further to 1,327 in 2017-18. A doctor said that HIV care has improved so much that very few deaths are recorded in the private sector, where patients pay for the latest medicine and get updated care."

        "title": "HIV on decline as Andhra Pradesh climbs to 4th spot in condoms usage",
        "body": "HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh has seen a 100% rise in usage of condoms in the last four years and is now the highest consumer of condoms among the four southern states and the fourth highest in the country. The rise in condom usage has brought down the HIV prevalence in the state significantly among its high risk group population. The 7.5 crore free condoms that were supplied for the high risk groups got exhausted much before the end of the year and the state had to request the Tamil Nadu government to donate their leftover 60 lakh condoms in March. Seeing the massive response, the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has added to AP\u2019s quota of condoms and will now ship 10.9 crore condoms this year. The authorities are attributing the substantial drop in the HIV prevalence rate to the increased condom usage. As per the survey conducted by AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) and Naco, that is being finalized, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers has dropped from 11% in 2008 to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. The sexually transmitted infections too have seen a drastic drop. Officials say that till about four years ago, the situation was so dismal that lakhs of condoms were wasted, having crossed their expiry dates because of no takers. But today, Apsacs is struggling to ensure that shortages don\u2019t crop up. \u201cPeople have become more health conscious now and they are also seeking the services of the integrated counseling and testing centres. This is a healthy trend,\u201d says T Kailashditya, joint director, targeting interventions, Apsacs. He added that Uttar Pradesh tops the country in condom usage and is followed by West Bengal, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Apsacs has been selling condoms at a subsidized rate to several sections such as truckers. Last year, 1.5 crore condoms were marketed like this for this population apart from the 7.5 crore free condoms doled out to the high risk groups. \u201cThe situation is such that we have to plan a month in advance for the supply to avoid a shortage,\u201d said the official. Besides, condoms are being lapped up over the counters by the general population. Experts said that factors such as education, benefits of condom use and perceived infection risk are also playing an important role. They added that after five years of effort, the demand for condoms has gone up and the HIV prevalence rate has shown a decline. However, the state still has the highest number of people (5 lakh) living with HIV/AIDS in the country."

        "title": "48% spurt in number of HIV patients receiving life-saving ART",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: An additional 1.2 million HIV patients across the globe were started on the life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in 2009 -- the highest number of infected availing of this medicare in a single year. According to latest WHO figures, an estimated 5.2 million HIV patients were receiving this life-saving treatment at the end of 2009. India is among the top 20 countries, which recorded the highest percentage increase in the number of people receiving ART between 2007 and 2008. Over this one year, there was a spurt in 48% of patients -- from 1.50 lakh to 2.34 lakh -- who could receive ART. The number of facilities with HIV testing and counselling in the country has also increased from 4,269 in 2007 to 4,817 in 2008. Since 2003, the number of people receiving HIV treatment has increased 12-fold globally. The cost needed for HIV treatment this year is pegged around $ 9 billion, according to UNAIDS. However, the future for the global fight against AIDS does not seem too bright, financially. A new report, released at the International Aids Conference in Vienna on Monday, says that donor nation support for AIDS relief was flat in 2009, thanks to the global meltdown, with only $7.6 billion provided during the year, ending the run of annual double-digit percentage point increases in donor support for international AIDS assistance since 2002 when donor governments provided a total of $1.2 billion. America remained the largest donor nation in the world, accounting for more than half (58%) of last year's disbursements, followed by the United Kingdom (10.2%), Germany (5.2%), the Netherlands (5%) and France (4.4%). \"Reductions in investment on AIDS programs are hurting the AIDS response. At a time, when we are seeing results in HIV prevention and treatment, we must scale up, not scale down,\" said Michel Sidibi, UNAIDS executive director. UNAIDS estimates that $23.6 billion was needed to address the epidemic in low-and middle-income countries in 2009. That suggests a growing gap of $7.7 billion between available resources and the need. Though the financial deficit comes as a cause for concern, Dr Hiroki Nakatani -- WHO's assistant director-general for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases -- has praised global efforts to put more and more patients on life-saving HIV drugs. \"The 1.2 million is the largest increase in people accessing treatment in a single year. It is an extremely encouraging development,\" he said. At the International AIDS Conference, WHO is calling for timely treatment for HIV patients. The basic objective is to begin treatment before they take ill because of weakened immunity. \"Starting treatment earlier gives us an opportunity to enable people living with HIV to stay healthier and live longer,\" says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO, director, HIV/AIDS. Estimates developed through epidemiological modeling suggest that HIV-related mortality can be reduced by 20% between 2010 and 2015 if these guidelines for early treatment are implemented. Earlier treatment can prevent opportunistic infections including tuberculosis -- the number one killer blow for HIV patients. Deaths from TB can be reduced by as much as 90%, if both HIV and TB patients are treated earlier. \"In addition to saving lives, earlier treatment has also prevention benefits,\" Dr Hirnschall says. \"Because treatment reduces the level of virus in the body, it means HIV-positive people are less likely to pass the virus on to their partners.\" WHO's treatment guidelines expand the number of people recommended for HIV treatment from an estimated 10 million to 15 million. Bernhard Schwartlander, director, evidence, strategy and results, UNAIDS, said, \"People with weaker immune systems who come late for treatment require more complex and costly drugs and services than those who start treatment earlier and are healthier.\" Asia's fight against AIDS * Number of HIV patients in 2008 was 4.7 million against 4.5 million in 2001 * Number of new HIV infections in 2008 was 3.5 lakh against 4 lakh in 2001 * Number of newly-infected children in 2008 was 21,000 against 33,000 in 2001 * Number of AIDS-related deaths in 2008 was 3.3 lakh against 2.8 lakh in 2001 * Asia is home to 60% of the world's population. But, it is second only to sub-Saharan Africa as far as HIV patients is concerned * India accounts for almost half of Asia's HIV prevalence * Only 37% of HIV patients in Asia, who require ART were getting it in 2008, which is below the global average of 42%"

        "body": "Researchers are trying to develop an injection that will replace the daily pill regimen for HIV patients. Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection. A team of researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center is progressing towards developing weekly or twice-monthly injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) nanomedicines for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of pills, lead investigator on the development of nanoART for HIV/AIDS and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said. A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC\u2019s ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections. \u201cWe actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person \u2013 and it worked,\u201d Dr. Gendelman said. \u201cThis is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.\u201d Dr. Gendelman said one of the project\u2019s real advantages is in the nanoformulations. \u201cNanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body\u2019s own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,\u201d he said. The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows. \u201cYou\u2019re using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,\u201d Dr. Gendelman said. Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made \u201ca Nebraska invention,\u201d as it involved so many of the state\u2019s scientists in different disciplines working together. He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy. The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by Georgette Kanmogne, Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease. The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study. \u201cWe work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,\u201d Dr. Gendelman said. This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches. The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC\u2019s development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment. Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills. The work will be presented at the forthcoming meeting for the American Society for Nanomedicine, where Dr. Gendelman will serve as conference chair. The study has been recently published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases."

Experts point that several national surveys, including the National Family Health Survey and the District Health Surveys, have pointed to low HIVAIDS awareness among people which could have led to an increase in late referrals, high dropout rates and poor treatment outcomes.It could also be because of a spike in death among those diagnosed with AIDS more than adecade ago, officials say."

        "body": "MELBOURNE: In a significant progress towards the development of a vaccine against HIV, scientists have developed a new approach to help the immune system actively fight the virus in the body. For the first time, researchers showed that a combined approach - using a common cold virus to introduce a vaccine into the body, as well as an injection of a DNA-based vaccine - may help protect against HIV in the gut and bodily cavities. \"With sexual activity being one of the primary methods of HIV transmission, it is necessary to try to protect those parts of the body that are most likely to encounter the virus first,\" said Branka Grubor-Bauk, from the University of Adelaide in Australia. \"A possible reason why previous HIV vaccine trials have not been successful is because of this lack of a frontline protection,\" Grubor-Bauk said. The laboratory studies, conducted so far in mice represent an important step forward in attempts to introduce a first line of defence against HIV at the site of infection. \"In mice, we delivered a rhinovirus (or common cold virus) inside the nose, and this virus had been altered to include HIV proteins,\" Grubor-Bauk said. \"At the same time, the mice also received an injection into the skin containing a DNA-based vaccine. This approach resulted in very specific responses in the immune system,\" she said. \"This vaccine approach encompasses two different arms of the immune system: white blood cells that attack the HIV virus, and specific antibodies that recognise and shut down HIV-positive cells,\" she added. \"There is an element of HIV known as Tat that helps the virus to replicate quite rapidly,\" said Eric Gowans, professor at University of Adelaide. The antibodies inhibit the Tat effect, preventing HIV from replicating itself, Gowans added. \"Overall, we found that infection was considerably reduced in the mice we studied,\" he said. The study appears in the journal Scientific Reports."

She said that the purpose of the workshop was to make the public and the hospital staff educated about Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV). She said that there are now more than 4,000 counselling and testing centres in all the major hospitals across the country. It was mentioned that HIV generally leads to an infection that destroys the body's immune system when in an advanced stage. This damage is irreparable and can cause further complications. Dr Chhina said that during the initial stages, a mild flu and swollen glands are common and these symptoms are often ignored till the situation worsens. She said that the disease is transmitted primarily through sex (anal, vaginal or oral) with an infected partner, by injections (sharing contaminated needles for drug abuse or accidental piercing of a contaminated needle), from an infected mother to her child through pregnancy or breast-feeding, infected semen and vaginal fluids and infected blood transfusion. It was also pointed out that everyday, the health care workers are exposed to occupational hazards and are therefore more prone to AIDS. The workshop was attended by 450 participants who also participated in a quiz at the end of the lectures and were awarded prizes."

But they are different, and so is this wedding, as both of them are HIV positive. The marriage will not be a low-key affair and all preparations are being done and being planned well. Invitation cards are also being distributed. The marriage will be solemnized at Aanchal Care Home, where the bride-to-be Geeta resides. Geeta, 22, has the disease for the past two years while Ramesh was infected with HIV four years ago. Ramesh is a sales officer in a private company in Bharatpur. The couple came to know each other through the RNP+ network, which is an NGO working for people living with HIV/AIDS. \u201cThe marriage will not only give a new meaning to the lives of the couple but also send out a message that people living with HIV/AIDS are also a part of society. Also, such a marriage will ensure that infection will not spread further,\u201d Prerna Singh, managing director, People\u2019s Trust (the NGO which is organizing the wedding) said. Singh added, \u201cGeeta is an orphan and has had a tough life. It will not be good to talk about her past at this happy moment.\u201d Ramesh is happy with the decision. He said, \u201cMarriages between those infected with HIV will give them support and encouragement.\u201d This marriage is not the first of its kind in the state. RNP+ president Brijesh Dubey said, \u201cSuch marriages were solemnized earlier also. But, this time it is being organized in a big way.\u201d Dubey also said that he has been receiving calls from NGOs of other states about this particular wedding."

        "body": "CHENNAI: One of the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s strongest partners in the fight against HIV/AIDS, Apac-VHS, operational since 1995, will close on Saturday as funding from USAIDS has ended. In its last meeting with state health secretary Girija Vaidyanathan on Friday, director Joseph Williams said all its HIV/AIDS projects had been handed over to the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs). Apac was administered by Voluntary Health Services, a non-profit hospital in Taramani, with funds from USAID. Apac completed two phases (1995-2007) and was currently in the third phase of prevention and care programmes in seven Tamil Nadu districts. \u201cIt\u2019s an end to the chapter. But we are certainly going to be working with the state government in other areas,\u201d Williams said. Vaidyanathan could not disagree. Tansacs and Apac, according to her, were more like siblings of the same family. In the late 1990s, when they began, they had many challenges \u2014 stigma, acceptance, early diagnosis and treatment. In the last 17 years, they, together, brought out several studies on prevalence of HIV/AIDS, behavioural pattern of people in high-risk groups and planned several strategies for prevention and rehabilitation of the disease among sex workers, truckers and drug users. They also planned programmes for care and support of those with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe worked on many projects together and at one point the line between Tansacs and Apac was almost invisible. With scientific models and technical support, Apac not only brought in valuable programme but also brought in systems,\u201d she said. For the first time, the government shared even the most uncomfortable data every survey and research it did on HIV/AIDS. Apac officials said they would continue to support the state health system projects in areas such as bio-medical waste management, equipment maintenance and help government develop communication research and data resource centers. Dr Lakshmibai, who joined Apac as a research officer, said the end of the programme did not mean end of need. \u201cWe managed to bring down the incidence but we will have to sustain awareness and prevention programmes for a few more years,\u201d she said. Lakshmibai is now project director of Tamil Nadu Aids Initative, another project backed by VHS."

        "body": "VARANASI: When the entire world would be observing the World AIDS Day (WAD) on Thursday (December 1), health experts of the region would be looking for ways to increase the number of registrations at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART), BHU, to focus on the theme 'getting to zero', aiming to intensify treatment and strengthen preventive measures to minimise the risk of HIV infection. While the centre has already emerged as the only centre of excellence between Kolkata and New Delhi in the northern parts of the country providing qualitative first line and second line treatment for AIDS, it is the low turnout of HIV positive people coming for screening and treatment at the centre which is baffling the experts. It is the same trend everywhere in the country and the ART centre of BHU is no exception. Out of nearly 2.2 million HIV positive people, only four lakh (less than 20%) patients are receiving treatment at ART centres across the country. Unless, 90% of the targeted population (HIV positive people) come under the purview of ART centres, 'getting to zero' target would be a difficult task, said Prof Shyamsunder, nodal officer of ART centre, BHU while talking to TOI on the eve of WAD on Wednesday. It may be mentioned here that ART Centre, BHU is also the nodal centre of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and UP state AIDS control society (UP SACHS). Apart from screening and treatment of HIV patients, the centre boasts of other facilities including integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC), voluntary counselling and testing centre (VCTC) and counselling centre for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPCTC) to intensify the HIV treatment and prevent its spread in the region. As per reports of ART centre, BHU, out of nearly 14,000 HIV positive people registered with the centre since its inception in 2005, around 5,000 HIV patients are receiving treatment at the centre. The low figure is enough to baffle experts especially when the centre caters wide range of populations coming from eastern UP along with neighbouring states of Bihar, MP, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand in the country. Attributing the low turnout at the ART centre to lack of awareness and social stigma attached to HIV infection, the nodal officer of centre also emphasised that massive awareness campaigns are needed to bring people out at the centre and use the facilities. It is one of the most successful and cost-effective government health programmes, which promises to increase the life-span of HIV patient up to 20 years. \"A collective effort and awareness campaign targeting vulnerable sections could cause the difference besides bringing HIV people at the centre,\" he said."

        "body": "PUNE: The Bombay High Court has commuted to life the death sentence awarded to a 29-year-old HIV patient, from Pune. He had raped his seven-year-old niece and then strangled her at Kasegaon village in Sangli in 2011. The bench comprising justices V K Tahilramani and V L Achliya observed, \"There can be no doubt that the offence committed by the accused deserves severe condemnation and it is a heinous crime, but on looking at the cumulative facts and on balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases. Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence.\" On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school. The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband. He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the Kasegaon police station. The rapist was arrested after investigations revealed his involvement in the crime. The victim's body was recovered from the sugarcane field. The trial court had sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC. He was also sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment each for kidnapping and destroying evidence under sections 363 and 201 of the IPC. The trial court had sent a reference to the high court for confirming the death sentence. He had also filed a criminal appeal challenging the death sentence in the high court. Additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused. She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group. She submitted that the rapist was a habitual offender as he had two cases registered against him with the Chinchwad police station here in 2009 and 2011. The HC later found that he had been acquitted in both the cases. The HC appointed lawyer Abhaykumar Apte to represent the man from its legal aid committee. Apte argued that police had not recorded his statement to show that the dead body was recovered at his instance. He also challenged the identification parade of the accused on the grounds that the witnesses had seen him at the police station. The HC's observations Quoting several Supreme Court judgments, the HC bench said, \"The man was suffering from HIV and this was the only mitigating circumstance in his favour for commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment.\" The HC also sought his doctor's advice on whether his life span will be that of an ordinary man if he continued with the medicines. While partly allowing his appeal, the HC on examining the evidence maintained his conviction under sections of the IPC, but commuted the death sentence given for murder to life imprisonment. The HC also commuted the life imprisonment awarded for rape to 10 years RI. However, both the sentences will run consecutively. The sentences of three years RI each awarded for kidnapping and destruction of evidence will run concurrently. The judgment was delivered on May 8 and posted on the HC website on June 18."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: A new treatment for HIV infection has been approved by US federal regulators which does not have the side effects associated with other drugs used to fight the virus that causes AIDS. The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya \u2014 a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide \u2014 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above. READ ALSO: New drug offers potential to keep HIV at bay indefinitely Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year. \u201cToday\u2019s approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,\u201d said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. \u201cIt was developed to help reduce some drug side effects,\u201d the regulator said. READ ALSO: Natural defence against HIV discovered According to USFDA, the new drug also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures. The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed. The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a \u2018Boxed Warning\u2019 alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The \u2018Boxed Warning\u2019 also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications."

Children were made to use plastic gloves and cover their face with a mask. The children at the orphanage are in the age group of 8 and 14. On Saturday, the children were forced to clean a choked drain and locals tipped off Balala Hakkula Sangham, who brought this to the notice of the Rachakonda police commissioner. \"When we entered the premises, we found children were cleaning the premises with broomsticks,\" Balala Hakkula Sangam member Achuta Rao told STOI. \u201cWe are regularly made to do domestic chores by the home authorities.

        "body": "LONDON: Scientists have for the first time peeled open the virus \u2014 that can lead to AIDS \u2014 from its shell raising giving a priceless insight into how it can be stopped from infecting millions across the globe every year. A team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have announced that they have peeled open HIV's outer coating and discovered 4-million-atom structure inside the protein shell. The findings, researchers say will ultimately lead the way to fending off an often-changing virus that has been very hard to conquer. It's been 30 years since the AIDS epidemic spread to every corner of the world killing nearly 30 million people, infecting more than 60 million. There is still no vaccine or cure for it Scientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus. HIV is among the most mutating viruses. Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together. Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, \"The capsid is critically important for HIV replication, so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,\" she said. \"This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate.\" Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice. But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined. Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together. \"The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,\" Dr Zhang said. \"The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing.\" \"By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,\" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian. \"The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics.\""

        "body": "Lucknow: A new protocol for management of HIV AIDS will be launched across AAL anti-retro-viral therapy (ART) centers across UP reducing the number of pills from three to one. It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART. HIV-AIDS patients would be put on fixed dose therapy (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver. Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV AIDS Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, \u201cFDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's Medical University it will be launched in mid-December.\u201d The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient\u2019s body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir. The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is. A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. \u201cSide effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,\u201d explained Dr Tripathi. Besides introducing this drug, National Aids Control Organisation has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading. It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB."

Dr Rohan Augustine, consultant nephrologist at Manipal Hospitals, who has been treating Oliver since July 2015, said: \u201cHIV patients were not considered transplant candidates as many believe that survival rates are less as the disease cripples the immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune system.\u201c With good anti-retroviral therapy, HIV patients receiving transplants now have better chances. Transplantation is the best way forward even for such patients on dialysis if they are medically fit.

Other peripheral staff works for Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC), Prevention of Parents to Child Transmission Centre (PPCTC), Blood bank, mobile ICTC and District Aids Control and Prevention Unit (DAPCU). Owing to the strike that began on Wednesday, all these units have been shut down. \"The Macs staff suddenly went on a strike putting the lives of HIV positive patients at risk. They should have at least issued sufficient ART drugs to us before launching the stir,\" L Deepak Singh, president of Manipur Network for Positive People (MNP +) said.

Since then gradually we have stepped up our campaign. With participation of all, we will be able to throw away AIDS from society,\" he said. The Art of Living believes in spreading the message of love and humanity to deal with people infected with HIV. \"I have met several people who are infected with the virus. They are just human beings like us. They need love and care from us to lead their lives normally,\" said Richa Chopra who has been involved with various humanitarian activities across the country. \"We can definitely help people by extending our care for them and encourage them to lead a normal life. A word of love could be a vital medicine for some people,\" she said, adding that the seminar would help the religious leaders to experience the idea and spread the message across to people. Assam health commissioner and secretary Prateek Hajela who was also present during the inaugural session of the seminar said prevention was the best way to pluck AIDS out of our world. \"The number of people infected with the virus has crossed 25 lakh in India and we need to be more conscious to stop its spread further. Besides, we need to be generous to those who have been infected already. We should not hurt them with our behaviour,\" he said. Ashish Bhutani GMDA commissioner and secretary stressed on the role of religious leaders and teachers in the society to prevent spread of AIDS. \"People believe more in religious leaders. If they decide to shoulder the responsibility, I think they can bring about a change,\" said Bhutani. Religious leaders from various parts of the state actively took part in the session and exchanged their feelings and experiences."

        "body": "JAIPUR: In a positive development for Rajasthan, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSW) in the has dropped drastically in the state. The HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, which was released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday, revealed that new infections among FSW have reduced in comparison to the figures of HSS 2008-09. The HSS showed that the HIV prevalence among FSW in 2010-11 has reduced from 3.82% to 1.28%. The national average of HIV prevalence among sex workers is 2.67%. In Rajasthan, the HIV prevalence among sex workers is below the national average. As part of the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programme, the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) have been promoting sale of condoms among high-risk groups which include sex workers in the state under the Condom Social Marketing (CSM) programme. They have also opened more than 9,228 non-traditional outlets, to sell condoms in the state to minimize the risk of HIV infection and also to reduce total fertility rate. The NGOs working for health of sex workers claimed that the FSW have become more attentive to their health. Yuwa Bharat Sansthan programme manager Pinki Shekhawat said, \"We have been working for FSW for a long time. Among the 600 FSWs in Jaipur with whom we are working, only one was tested positive for HIV.\" She said the FSWs are using precautions properly to prevent HIV infection. \"Some of FSWs go to other states, which have high HIV prevalence, which is quite risky for them, but they are more careful there about their health,\" Shekhawat said. The FSWs undergo routine health check-up. The RSACS has also introduced targeted intervention to keep a check on the spread of prevalence of HIV among FSWs. There are around 22 targeted interventions working with FSW population in the state, RSACS sources said. In a survey conducted in 2005-06, it was found that there were 21,301 female sex workers in the state but now the number of FSW must have increased, an RSACS source added."

        "body": "Nagpur: Unclear instructions from the Centre has led to NGOs working to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS not getting any funds for their projects for half a year. Having spoken to Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) officials for months now, project directors of the affected projects have now decided to get in touch with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to resolve the issue. With international funds drying up, NACO had decided to share the expenses on AIDS prevention and awareness with the state governments since the beginning of the current financial year. However, clear instructions about the proportion of the funds to be borne by NACO and the state was not communicated. This has meant that the NGOs have received no funds for the projects at all for at least five months. Some of the project directors from the region met health secretary Sujata Sounik and MSACS project director Khushalsingh Pardesi on Tuesday. These included Anand Chandrani of Sarathi Trust, Rajabhau Jodh from Manav Vikas Sanstha, Dr Raghunath Wadekar from Amravati\u2019s RSTM Bahuddeshiya Sanstha and Devendra Kshirsagar of Sahyadri Foundation. \u201cThe officials told us that they were aware of the problems we were facing and that they were not in a position to help. They also assured us that \u2018some part\u2019 of the pending funds would be disbursed by early next month,\u201d said Chandrani. Meanwhile, the expenses made by every NGO are being sent to MSACS and forwarded to NACO every month to which no response has been received from the central agency yet. The funds he is talking about amount to Rs11crore that MSACS is due to get from NACO at the end of this month. A huge chunk of this money is supposed to go towards the pending bills of medicines, half of it is promised to be paid to the staff of the projects and the remaining would go towards the continuity of the projects. \u201cThere are 156 NGOs working in the state, each with around 30 staffers. All of these people have been working without salaries from six to eight months, project directors are either spending from their pockets or availing of loans. The little money that will be given to every organization won\u2019t cover more than a couple of months\u2019 worth of expenditure and salaries,\u201d worried Kshirsagar. He added financial troubles had led to many NGOs dropping their projects, and many more considering the same. Other activists are worried that this will weaken the country\u2019s AIDS control programme. \u201cWork done on the ground level by our workers cannot be done by the government on its own. If the awareness and targeted intervention programmes stop, the HIV positivity rate in India may go up,\u201d said Dr Wadekar."

Nodal officer Dr Savita Daruwala of the Vashi ART centre said, \"This is a well- equipped and adequately staffed centre with a good laboratory and diagnostic services, and screening facilities. The centre, that started in 2009, has registered 6,000 cases so far, out of which 3,500 (including 160 children) patients are still on medication.\" She has also submitted a proposal to MSACS to increase the number of ART centres in the city. The superintendent of Vashi civic hospital, Dr Prashant Jawade said, \"Two more civic hospitals are coming up in Airoli and Nerul and they might start new ART centres there, too. But one can only set up ART centres by following the mandatory norms laid by MSACS.\" While Celebrating World AIDS Day , has laid down new regime called '0 Cases' and everywhere across the state PPTCT program ( Prevention of Parent To Child Transmission) is going on.

        "body": "# HIV: A virus called Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+ lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections. # How it spreads: HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, handshakes, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, migrant population, truck drivers, sex workers and IV drug abusers are the worst affected. They in turn spread the disease to their wives, children and clients. # How to get tested: Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) provides free testing and counselling. ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. Those who test positive are referred to the nearest Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre. # Treatment: Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available which can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be put on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment to prevent failure of the drug regimen. # Who To Approach: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies, and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at MLN Medical College provides HIV testing, treatment, counseling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients. # Protection & Support To Children affected with AIDS: In the short term, National Aids Control Programme is reaching out to as many children living with HIV as possible to provide them with the treatment and the care and support services that they need. # In the long term, NACP aims to ensure that every child has access to the same comprehensive set of basic health, education and social protection services, regardless of their HIV status or that of any member of their family.

When she regained consciousness, she was told that she had \u2018eloped\u2019 with him. She was finally forced into marriage in January, 2010.

She, however, managed to wriggle out of her husband\u2019s clutches and fled to her parent\u2019s house in Imphal West. She got her blood sample examined at an Imphal lab in February and tested positive for HIV, she said. The woman told the chief judicial magistrate, Imphal West, that she was forced to marry a man who hid his HIV status and now, she was a victim of the disease. She also charged him and his in-laws with torture. Human rights lawyer Rakesh Meihoubam said this is the first of its kind in Manipur and second in the country. In Delhi, a woman filed a criminal case against her husband for transmitting HIV without her knowledge, but the case didn\u2019t move forward as the husband died of AIDS.

        "body": "ALLAHABAD : Acknowledging that awareness is the key to checking the transmission of HIV\\AIDS in migrant areas, the officials of District Aids Programme Control Unit (DAPCU ) are reaching out to migrant labourers and truckers through folk artists, apprising them about methods helpful in preventing the spread of the deadly ailment. DAPCU officials said at least 40% individuals among the target groups of migrant labouers and truckers were not aware of the factors responsible for the spread of AIDS. DAPCU has deputed teams of Meerut, Kanpur, and Lucknow-based folk artists to spread awareness among the target groups. With Allahabad district already classified under 'A' category by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) as far as spread AIDS transmission is concerned, all prevention and care interventions specified by the organization need to be scaled up on a priority basis. Allahabad district has a very large flow of migrants and truckers. It also has a high population of the most vulnerable age group (18-35 years). Under the strategy, two street plays or other events are being held in 60 selected villages with basic health workers motivating villagers to attend the folk artistes' show. Moreover, the artistes are also carrying out counselling and IEC (information, education and communication) sessions for truckers/migrant labouers, who are one of the strongest modes of HIV transmission across the state. Exemplifying the axiom 'think globally, act locally', labourers , once apprised about the factors responsible behind the deadly disease, promise folk artists that they would do their bit in spreading awareness on AIDS on their part and ensure that each and every villager broadly know how the incurable disease is transmitted. A total of 60 spots have been identified and would be covered till June 27. DAPCU's nodal officer Dr OP Shahi points out, \"When it comes to dispelling myths about factors behind transmission of HIV/AIDS and control measures, folk show has always proved to be a hit for spreading awareness especially among rural masses.\" Be it the elderly or teenager, all were briefed about the causes that spread the deadly disease. \"More stress is being made on villages which are sensitive in terms of transmission of hiv or High risk group people are staying\". Dr Shahi said, \"We are also organizing counselling sessions promptly with an aim to check the transmission of the deadly disease.\" He added that under directives of NACO and UP State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS), more stress has been laid in areas where high-risk groups like female sex workers (FSW) and injecting drug users (IDUs) stay and these areas have been taken under the scanner. Authorities have already recommended implementation of the link workers programme in Category A and B districts of the country in a phased manner, more stress has been paid to Allahabad district, as its boundary connects it with seven other districts. The fact is that apart from migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. Efforts are also underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi."

The only centre in AP for training counsellors is at the psychology department of AU.AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) sources said due to 20% cut in the annual budget for the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), officials could not take up the mandatory training sessions for the district level counsellors. For the years 2014 to 2016, the budget has been cut from Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 1,300 crore. This has affected the HIV/AIDS control programme. A portion of the fund is diverted to Swachh Bharat and skill development programmes.Earlier, the training centre for counsellors used to get funds from abroad routed through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) under the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria project. But after the stipulated eight-year period of funding was over, there was no money to continue the project. Project director and head of the of AU psychology department Prof MVR Raju said, \"We used to train counsellors every three months, with around 30 counsellors in each batch. Each ART or HIV treatment centre in the state is supposed to have counsellors for patients and there are more than 700 such counsellors in the state. But since the last two years, we didn't receive any funding from APSACS. The HIV/AIDS control programme is not being given much importance in the last two years. Not only for this project, but for other educational projects too, we find the funds not forthcoming and on enquiry find that part of UGC funds gets diverted for skill development and Swachh Bharat.\"Even the State AIDS Control Society officials admitted to the shortage of funds for the last two years and reduction in NACO budget. A SACS official said, \"The new government doesn't encourage international donors like UNICEF and global funds and NACO had to undergo a budget cut in 2014-16 period of Rs 400 crore. The various SACS used to get funds directly from NACO but even that was discontinued and SACS had to get them through government treasury. Every time, there would be a delay of 4-5 months.\"\"However, the treasury system was removed this year and again we are directly getting funds from NACO and after all the states had complained about the budget cut, the allocation for NACO has been raised to its earlier Rs 1,700 crore from this fiscal. But due to the 20% cut in the last two years, we were unable to give salaries, organise capacity building, training programmes and workshops all over India and the overall HIV/AIDS control programme had been hit,\" added the SACS official."

He stated that the target is to minimise the number of new cases as far as possible. \"People usually tend to dismiss warnings given by experts who say that prevention is the best control of the disease. But this shows that they have not been able to assess the real depth of the problem. Awareness campaigns are a must for them,\" he stated. Preetam Kaur, a mother whose lost her daughter is suffering from to the stigma against HIV. AIDS has recently formed an HIV positive women welfare society. On behalf of the society, she distributed blankets and eatables to HIV positive persons undergoing treatment for complication of the disease at anti-retroviral therapy centre in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Along with volunteers, she warned patients and attendants visiting the hospital to be careful about HIV and AIDS. Contributions for the cause were made by the social organisations as well. In one such effort, a red ribbon truck was taken out by caring souls foundation. Lucknow's first citizen, Mayor Dinesh Sharma started a signature campaign on the truck, which moved to 20-25 different locations. In another programme, experts at Unicef spoke about the need to help positive mothers and children fight the complications. \"They all need the support of family members, neighbours, teachers, doctors and leaders to keep the complications of the primary infection at bay and lead a healthier life,\" said Adele Khudr, chief of field office, of Unicef UP. It may be noted that about 1,09,352 persons, including 42,647 are women and 4,811 are children below 15 years are living in UP. She added that while various agencies have been striving to do away discrimination from institutions like schools and hospitals, the more difficult struggle is to wipe out discrimination from the heart and mind of people. \"A change in mindset is the call of the hour. People living with HIV and AIDS need health care, counselling and above all our love, compassion. They need to feel that they have been accepted by all of us,\" she stated."

Statistics from Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) show that of the 200 new cases of mother-to-child transmission detected in 2017, most were in the age group of 10 to 15. The data correlates with a study published last year by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis. Researchers surveyed 656 children in Tamil Nadu in the 5-14 age group who registered for HIV care in 43 centres that offer antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. One in five of these children were lost to follow-up in a year. Children less than 15 years old constitute 7% of the HIV-infected in India. More than 90% of these cases are the result of mother-tochild transmission (MTCT). Doctors can say with certainty by the 18th month if an infant has got the virus from an infected mother, HIV specialist Dr S Sundar said. \u201cThe state loses its first opportunity of preventing transmission by putting infected mothers on ARV prophylaxis too late,\u201d he said. Adequate ARV can reduce risk of MTCT to less than 2%. It misses a second opportunity after a child is diagnosed, Dr Sundar said. \u201cIn some instances, they may not show symptoms. There are chances that they will infect others as adults,\u201d he said. Doctors say early diagnosis and initiation of ART in children less than two years of age is important as failure to do so may result in early mortality. As for the rest, a study published recently by doctors from the Institute of Child Health, Egmore, offers a telling picture. The team studied 100 children (18 months to 12 years) who were diagnosed with HIV in a government medical college in Salem: About 20% of children under the age of four died due to complications related to the disease, 25% of them had tuberculosis, 12% of them had problems with their central nervous system and 16% had blood-related disorders. Only 22 of them were asymptomatic. Dr Murali Thandavarayan, one of the authors, said besides clinical manifestations, a majority were malnourished. \u201cHIV in children has faster progression because of immature immunity. Early identification and management is crucial,\u201d he said. Officials say reasons for the loss to follow-up include unaccounted deaths, healthy children whose caregivers do not perceive the need to visit the ART centre, distance to these centres as well as the stigma involved. \u201cSometimes we find it difficult to track these children as the mothers deliver in their parents\u2019 homes,\u201d said Dr E Suresh, who heads the ART centre in ICH. Tansacs officials said they stepped up surveillance in the past six months. If children do not attend on the scheduled date, the outreach workers immdiately contact the family. *name changed"

        "title": "Among blood donors, 157 found HIV positive last year",
        "body": "RAIPUR: Like any well-meaning citizen, Prakhar (name changed), a young man in his mid 20s, went to donate blood at a camp last year to fulfill his social responsibility. However, his world changed after the visit, as the blood test revealed that he was HIV positive. Prakhar was shattered. However, a year later, still unhappy with his fate, he's coping well and feels that the early detection, though unintended, saved his life. What happened to Prakhar brings to fore the grim reality of high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are ignorant of their status. Data provided by Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS) reveals that of the total people who donated blood in 2011 in the state as many as 157 were found to be HIV positive. These people were not aware of the fact that they were carriers of the deadly virus. The detections happened as the donated blood is mandatorily tested for HIV virus and is completely destroyed, if found infected. Statistics show that there are 16 government and 22 private blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacements. Last year, 8185 units of blood was collected in camps and 50,132 people donated voluntarily. Of the 50,132 voluntary donations, 157 donors were found positive for HIV, implying that one out of every 320 people were carriers of the AIDS virus. According to the Chhattisgarh State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus. The society stated that one should take blood only from a licensed blood bank where it is tested for HIV. In 2008, around 10,534 people had donated blood out of which 145 were tested HIV positive. In 2009 this figure increased to 150, from 24,164 donors. In 2010, of the 49,458 blood donations 154 were found to be positive for HIV. To deal with the problem, the CSACS has taken the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS, interacting with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease."

State health minister Lalrinliana Sailo, while addressing the training said that blood samples of 17,729 pregnant women were tested during last year and efforts were being made to test the blood samples of at least 22,000 pregnant women this year. Sailo said that efforts should be made to ensure that all the women receive counselling and HIV tests during pregnancy to avoid high rate of infant mortality due to infection of HIV through perinatal."

        "title": "IMA bats for nucleic acid test over Elisa to detect HIV",
        "body": "KOCHI: Indian Medical Association's Kochi branch has asked city hospitals to choose nucleic acid test (NAT) over the traditional Elisa test to detect HIV , hepatitis B and C, especially before blood transfusion. This was after IMA, analysed blood samples of 49,000 persons and found that Elisa test failed to detect several infections, thus increasing the risk of transmitting bloodborne diseases from donor to recipient. IMA conducted Elisa test as well as NAT on all 49,000 persons who donated blood to IMA 's blood bank over the past three years. The results showed that eight cases of hepatitis B, one HIV and one case of hepatitis C were not detected by Elisa test. However, it was detected using NAT. \u201cBlood transfusion is a lifesaving procedure. But, there is always minimal risk of transmitting blood-borne infections like HIV , hepatitis B and C from the donor to the recipient. The conventional Elisa test employed in blood banks fail to detect infections in the window period,\u201c said IMA president Dr M Narayanan. At present, only IMA 's blood bank has NAT facility in the city . While donors in the city welcomed the move, they were concerned about two things: cost and whether it is a ploy by private companies to sell their NAT kit. \u201cStudies have shown that NAT is better than Elisa.Government hospitals have to introduce NAT to popularise it,\u201c said Jishnu Raj, coordinator, Blood Donors, Kerala.While Elisa test costs around Rs 400, NAT costs Rs 800. Both Elisa and NAT are used to determine if a person has antibodies related to certain infectious conditions. However, there is the issue of window period. Window period is the length of time after infection during which a test has a higher chance of incorrectly reporting the absence of disease (false negative). The window period for antibody tests can range from 3 weeks to 6 months. \u201cNucleic acid tests typically have shorter window periods, and this means that they can be used more reliably , particularly in cases where the exact point of infection isn't entirely clear,\u201c said Dr Narayanan. NAT was first introduced between 1999 and 2001 in blood banks across France, Germany , Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Studies showed that countries that introduced NAT have en countered a decrease in residual risk of viral transmissions. Although, other safety measures such as more stringent selection of blood donors have contributed as well; a marked decrease is evident. The residual risk for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission prior to NAT was 0.64 cases per million in France and 3.94 per million in Spain which decreased to 0.1 per million and 2.33 per million respectively after NAT was adopted.HIV NAT yield rates were estimated at 0.3 per million donations in France and Spain as opposed to 0.59 and 2.48 respectively preceding NAT. IMA's move is crucial as India has the second-highest pool of HIV persons estimated at 5.7 million and 3-5% HBV and 1-2% HCV cases reported among a population of almost 1.2 billion. Post-transfusion prevalence of hepatitis has been observed at 1-1.8% for hepatitis B and 0.28-0.5% for hepatitis C and 0.23-0.47 for HIV. \u201cTo ensure that blood banks and hospitals shift to NAT, we will soon be conducting a training session for doctors,\u201c added Dr Narayanan."

        "body": "PANAJI: The state wing of the Medical Council of India (MCI) has expressed its inability to take action against a doctor in Rivona who allegedly gave misinformation about HIV/AIDS to parents from the village who were opposing the admissions given by a local school to 13 HIV-positive students from a community care centre. The Goa medical council\u2019s ethics and disciplinary committee\u2014heeding the state commission for protection of child rights\u2019 complaint against Dr Auvduth Prabhudessai\u2014has concluded that since the doctor is not registered with the council it has no jurisdiction in the case. The commission\u2019s chairperson Samira Kazi said the department is exploring other possibilities of taking action against Prabhudessai. When contacted by STOI, Prabhudessai refused to reveal what he had advised the villagers, saying only, \u201cI\u2019m responsible for the welfare of my village.\u201d Asked if he had misinformed locals about HIV/AIDS, he said he would reply only to an inquiry against him. Chief minister Manohar Parrikar recently assured the legislative assembly that action would be taken against the doctor, after Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldessai raised the issue in the House. Before his retirement, Prabhudessai worked for the directorate of health services and also served in the armed forces. Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona. Asked if he is open to the idea of children with HIV being given admissions in regular schools, Prabhudessai said, \u201cIt is a debatable issue.\u201d He refused to elaborate, saying he did not want to answer such questions telephonically. He informed STOI that he was registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council after getting his degree, as the Goa council did not exist then, and later he did register with the Goa council. It is mandatory for every doctor to register with the state medical council or MCI if they want to practice in India. It is also compulsory for doctors to renew this registration every five years. The controversy over admissions to HIV-positive children raged for over a fortnight in June-July, and was finally resolved through government intervention. It saw over 40 parents withdraw their wards from the school where the children with HIV were finally admitted."

        "body": "BARNALA/MANSA: With AIDS spreading its tentacles in the state and claiming lives of both parents in several families, the fate of their infected children has become pitiable. This, especially, since the government has failed to reach out to such orphaned children or provide any medical help despite the fact that they too are infected. Three small sisters and another brother-sister duo, not only have lost both their parents to AIDS, but the disease has been transmitted to them from their parents and has now, acquired full-blown form. The siblings' story is not an isolated one as there are hundreds such orphans in villages across Punjab. After losing father Raj Singh, Bhucho resident and a truck driver, in 2003, Lakwinder, then only 7-year-old, and his 4-year-old sister Jaspreet became orphans when they lost mother Karamjit Kaur, too, because of AIDS, two years later. When other family members (Raj Singh's elder brother) got to know that the kids too have contracted the disease, they drove them away. Then the kid's aunt, Kanti Devi, (deceased Karamjit's sister) came to their aid and brought both to her place in Mansa. Since then, both Lakhwinder and Jaspreet are living a miserable life with three children of Kanti at a dingy residence in ward number 16. She and her husband, Kuku Halwai, have no issues keeping the children. \"We are making both ends meet on our meagre resources,\" said Kanti, adding that the state government had miserably failed in providing any assistance to the AIDS-affected children. Kanti said in 2006, Holland-based NRI Gurmeet Singh Khaira had helped them and the family did not face much problem for about three years, but now again, they were facing financial hardship as both the children had to go to PGI for regular check up. Because of scarring on his face, Lakhwinder was thrown out of school but, Kanti, somehow, managed to get both enrolled in a small school in the neighbourhood. Likewise, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) rendered three sisters orphan on August 2, 2010, when their mother Rani Kaur died of AIDS. Six months back, their father Soma Singh, a truck driver, had died of the disease. Thirty-five-year-old truck driver Soma Singh used to remain away from the house for longer durations. \"During one of his trips, Soma fell ill seriously. It was then that we came to know that Soma was suffering from AIDS. After some days, he succumbed to the deadly virus,\" said Soma's brother Malkit Singh. After Soma's death, his wife Rani Kaur, too, was found suffering from AIDS apart from TB. Shuffling between anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre, Rani too bade goodbye to life leaving behind schoolgoing daughters Jasbir Kaur (13), Amrit (12) and 7-year-old Karamjit. Now, their single room hut in the Sansi mohalla (slum area) is their only adobe. \"Life has snatched everything from us, but still we hope to complete studies and stand on our feet,\" said Jasbir, with pain peeping through her eyes."

        "body": "The new plan includes introduction of third-line treatment for over 1 lakh patients, increasing the benchmark for those eligible for free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and ensuring more supplies of contraceptives. This assumes significance as the AIDS control programme, which is on the verge of maturing from receiving international funding, suffered a huge cut in budgetary allocation last year. This led to shortage of condoms, medicines and testing kits across the country. In fact some states also sacked healthcare workers involved with the programme blaming it on financial crunch. However, this year's budget has proposed an allocation of Rs 1,615 crore for the programme, as compared to Rs 1,300 crore under the revised estimates of 2015-16. \"We are taking a holistic approach. Therefore, we have now covered over 1 lakh patients for third-line treatment. We have also raised the bar for CD4 count for those who will be eligible for free treatment,\u201c health minister J P Nadda said. Currently, anyone who has a CD4 cell count of 350, and consequently, a very high viral load, is eligible for free ARTs. Under the new plan, which will be implemented from April, patients below 500 CD4 count will get free ARTs. This is in line with the guidelines from World Health Organisation (WHO), which recommends free ARTs for all HIV patients. According to a senior official, the increase in coverage of patients for free ARTs alone would entail an investment of around Rs 75-80 crore. Besides, the plan to introduce third-line treatment is estimated to be worth Rs 11crore. Besides, the government has also cleared a tender to procure 325 million pieces of condoms from the open market, a process which was pending for almost four years. Though latest HIV estimates by the government shows a 66% decline in new cases in the last five years, India still has the third highest number of people living with HIV and recorded an average of 86,000 new infections in 2015."

        "body": "MUMBAI: Susheel Jha has had an unusual experience with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A resident of the central suburbs, he proudly announces unlike many HIV-positive patients, he has never been bedridden by frequent bouts of illnesses. He credits his health to his family and hisemployer, the Indian Railways, who have been supportive ever since he was diagnosed with HIV while randomly donating blood at a donation camp way back in 1997. The unusual patient scaled another height three months back; he became the first HIV-positive person in Maharashtra to undergo a kidney transplant. In the stigma-ridden world of HIV/AIDS, 45-year-old Jha's story holds out hope for the two-million-plus Indians living with HIV. In Jha's case, his 64-year-old mother Sitara donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son. \"I just want to see my child living healthily next to me,\" she said over the phone from Benares. The transplant is a milestone of sorts. Not surprisingly then, Jha's nephrologist Dr M Bahadur, transplant surgeon Shailesh Raina and medical consultant Dr Om Srivasatava are ecstatic with his progress since the transplant was carried out at Jaslok Hospital last November 26. \"This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant. It needs experienced specialists to manage the patient carefully so as to ensure that his body doesn't reject the donor organ while ensuring that the HIV infection doesn't flare up,\" Bahadur, who has been treating Jha since 2006, said. Admitting that it had indeed been a challenge to handle a HIV-positive patient, Srivastava said that the right medical environment (as in a super-speciality hospital like Jaslok), right protocol and medicines were needed for such transplants. \"If the HIV-positive patient's CD4 count is adequate and his viral load is negative, then he can safely undergo a transplant,\" added the Jaslok doctors. Worldwide, too, transplants for HIV-positive patients are a relatively new concept. In 2004, the US reported about a 100-odd liver and kidney transplants for HIV-positive patients. The man himself is calm. \"My HIV status was detected in 1997 and my kidney failure in 2006.\" He was on dialysis for three years before doctors realised that transplant would be the only hope for him. \"In my 13 years with HIV, I took only 77 days of leave but I needed over three months of leave for the kidney transplant and the minor problems that cropped up after it,\" he said. Jha also believes that his employer, the Railways, played a great role in his \"healthy but HIV\" status. \"I have had access to antiretroviral drugs for the past 10 years. I was never discriminated against or passed up for promotion at my workplace. My dialysis would cost tens of thousands of rupees but the railways always paid up. They even paid for my transplant,\" added the father of two. Dr Harsh Jauhari, one of the seniormost nephrologists in the country, said that while a couple of HIV-positive patients had undergone transplants in India, little was chronicled about these special patients. \"There is a confidentially clause with HIV-positive patients that cannot be tampered with. So it is likely that we don't know about all the transplants that have taken place in this category. But there is no denying that these patients need specialised care,\" added the Delhi-based Jauhari. Another senior doctor said there were several issues about safety about the medical staff involved as well that had not allowed HIV-positive transplants so far. Incidentally, a study published in the Archives of Surgery last year by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients could have the same one-year survival rates for themselves and their donor organs as those without HIV, if certain risk factors for transplant failure were recognized and tightly managed. According to the report, \"HIV patients were earlier not considered transplant candidates as researchers thought that the survival rates after transplantation were greatly compromised by the disease, which cripples the body's immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune systems in order to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune systems.\" (The patient's name has been changed.)"

HIV-positive , disoriented, and bearing a gaping wound infested with maggots, the 40-year-old woman was found on a street outside the hospital last Monday. The case has again highlighted the plight of mentally unstable destitutes left on the capital\u2019s streets to fend for themselves. When TOI visited the hospital on Saturday, the woman was lying on a bed with a sheet draped over her head. Records show she was earlier treated at the hospital\u2019s ENT department for a severe ear infection and then taken away by an NGO. But this time, she was found dumped outside the hospital, disoriented and sick, with maggots digging into a severely infected wound behind her ear. Sources said the woman had been put through neurological tests and will need regular dressing for her wounds till all the maggots are cleared. Till then, a question mark will hang over her nutrition. Since she is admitted to the emergency ward, there is no arrangement for meals, and her nutritional requirements are not being met as per her physical status, sources said. \u201cShe is surviving on intravenous fluids. The staff members have been buying food to feed her off and on,\u201d the source added. LNJP medical superintendent Dr Richa Dewan denied any negligence in the treatment of the destitute woman. \u201cWe found her outside our hospital on September 12. She was very sick. But we have admitted her and have managed to give her every possible treatment . But till the maggots are cleared we cannot think of any other kind of intervention. After this problem is solved, we will start her on anti-retro viral treatment (for HIV) and look into her psychiatric needs. She is being kept in the emergency, as it a place where she can be looked after better,\u201d Dewan said. On what the government proposes to do for the growing number of destitutes on the streets, minister for health and family welfare, Kiran Walia, said she was concerned. With no ready solution to offer, the minister said her department was planning to set up two halfway homes for the homeless who are in need of long-term care, and also a hospice for elderly destitutes."

Savio Falleiro, associate professor, Rosary College, Navelim, awarded a PhD for the thesis, found that the disease has made household members above 60 years and below 16 years, both often HIV positive themselves, take up paid employment to make up for the shortfall in income. \"Whether in terms of number of households managing to save or amounts saved, savings are conspicuously extremely poor in case of HIV/AIDS households,\" said Falleiro. He held that close to 40% of households studied also experienced deaths of AIDS members aged between 18-40 years and often employed. \"Many families depend on borrowings and are forced to sell land, jewellery, household items to survive. 75% of HIV/AIDS households made no provision for their children's futures,\" said Falleiro. He felt the state should come up with a mechanism to give equal opportunities to all, irrespective of HIV status, while firms should not fire employees if they can work and if colleagues are not subjected to any risk."

        "body": "JAIPUR: Looking to an increase in the prevalence of HIV in state, the government is planning to conduct HIV screening tests on a large scale but with the consent of test takers. The facility will now be made available in the remotest primary health centres (PHCs) of state. Earlier, the health authorities were targeting only high risk groups for the test. But now even the common population will be brought in its ambit and free HIV card test will be made available in the remotest PHCs in state. The HIV test, apart from 14 other tests, will be provided free-of-cost at all PHCs from April 15 under the chief minister free diagnostic test scheme phase III. The test is already free at district hospitals and community health centres (CHCs). According to the recently-released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), the prevalence of HIV in state increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.38 in 2011-12. Rajasthan is a low prevalence state but is highly vulnerable due to the presence of high risk groups including female sex workers, injectable drug users, truckers and labourers. Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) project director Dr SS Chauhan said, \"Earlier, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and RSACS provided free test to high risk groups only. Also, in cooperation with National Rural Health Mission many Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) were started. But, now the government has decided to reach out to the common population. So, the HIV card test will be made available at PHCs also from April 15.\" The RSACS has already provided training to para-medical staff for counseling and tab technicians for conducting tests at CHCs and now there are plans to provide training to the staff at all PHCs. \"But, without a person's consent, no one can conduct HIV test. So, consent is must and compulsory for HIV testing,\" an RSACS official said. Moreover, RSACS has set a target to conduct HIV test on all pregnant women, added the official. It is estimated that 19 lakh infants are born every year in Rajasthan. So, by screening pregnant women, transmission of virus from mother to child can be prevented. \"There is 25-30% risk of transmission of virus from infected mother to the baby, but that risk can be minimized by the screening test and by giving medicines to the infected mother,\" he said."

He will first see his regular patients at his clinic in Nalaband Chowk here, and then counsel those who are still trying to come to terms with their medical condition. But that's not the clincher. The 57-year-old has been tirelessly treating the poor and the needy affected by HIV for free for over 10 years. His acts of kindness have reportedly touched 10,000 lives, especially children and women. He also keeps aside about 10% of his salary to treat people living with HIV. Dr Patil, who hails from Aheri village in Bijapur taluk, found that his true calling lay in the field of HIV/AIDS treatment soon after he finished his specialization in skin diseases at Mysore. His training at St Joseph's Medical College, Swamy Vivekananda Institute and an NGO working on preventing infections helped him take the road less travelled. As he treats his patients day in and day out, he has also been working on getting rid of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. \"I always wanted to give back to society. My father, who was a teacher, has been my inspiration throughout. Our society should not stigmatize those affected by AIDS. It is just a type of disease; nothing else.\" Ravi Kittur, a counsellor at the district hospital, says the doctor also makes time out of his busy schedule to visit villages once a month to check up on his patients. \"He also refers those who need further diagnosis or treatment and are hard put to other specialists who offer concessions. He takes extra care of patients from rural areas.\" To fulfil his aim, Dr Patil floated an NGO - Sri Gurukrupa Seva Samsthe - in the name of his late father, which creates awareness about HIV/AIDS in rural areas. Surekha (name changed), a former patient of Dr Patil, says she has been closely watching the doctor at work for about two years. \"Patients in rural areas look forward to his visits. They feel free to discuss their problems and conditions with him and pay heed to his suggestions.\" Before his launched his clinic, Dr Patil worked as an honorary doctor with an NGO and served at the community care centre attached to the district hospital. Support for those affected by HIV, he says, goes a long way in ensuring their long lives."

The HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, released recently, showed that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has increased from 0.19% (in 2008-09) to 0.38% in 2010-11. Now, taking note that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has increased in Rajasthan, the NACO has directed Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), an NGO, which played important role in decreasing HIV/AIDS prevalence in Karnataka to develop \"learning sites\" in Rajasthan so that the programmes of NACO would be implemented in a more effective way. The officials of KHPT were in the city on Wednesday, as a training programme of NGOs by Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) was held. An RSACS official said: \"The KHPT have selected five NGOs which will provide every kind of support by KHPT to develop them as learning sites for other NGOs working in the field of implementing programmes for controlling spread of HIV/AIDS.\" Moreover, an 11-member team of RSACS will head for Karnataka on Thursday to share their experience with Karnataka State Aids Control Society (KSACS) and KHPT. Rajasthan is a low HIV/AIDS prevalence state but the slight increase in prevalence of people living with HIV/AIDS has increased worries for the RSACS and NACO. The official said that there are many things which Rajasthan is quite good like care, support and mainstreaming of people living with HIV/AIDS. He said that they would do \"cross-learning\" with Karnataka on implementation of programmes. Earlier, in Karnataka, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS was quite high but later they developed a system with NGOs which helped them in decreasing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Now, all the efforts which Karnataka has done, the RSACS would learn from them and implement it in the state. Rajasthan is low prevalent but it is highly vulnerable because of presence of high risk groups including female sex workers, MSM, truckers, migratory population etc."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Centre to provide shelter to five terminally ill HIV/AIDS patients, who approached court, seeking relief. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Mishra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked the government to step in and ensure that the patients, who are also the petitioners, are provided shelter and are no longer abandoned. Earlier, the petitioners had highlighted their plight before court and pointed out that the tussle between different departments of the government had resulted in them being rendered homeless. They had added that they were forced to live with mentally challenged women. One of the petitioners, Sreerupa Mitra Chaudhury, informed the bench that the five persons were being taken care of by her organization, the Shramik Referral Centre for People Living with HIV/AIDS; however, they were rendered homeless after being evicted from the building that housed the centre and had nowhere to go. Both their families and the government had dispossessed the petitioners for no fault of theirs and simply because they were HIV positive, the petitioners said. They also pointed out that the HIV/AIDS infected destitute people need a facility of hospice, a night shelter or a halfway home and long-staying home for survival, well-being, continuing medical care and nutritional support. The evicted persons, who used to work as labourers in the unorganized sector, need labour welfare centres for holistic single-window service for their care and support. \u201cIt is very difficult for the destitute, people of the street to manage and exist with HIV/AIDS infection and its numerous associated complications,\u201d Chaudhury said in her plea, urging the court to intervene. Seeing the gravity of the situation, the bench asked the Central government to seek instructions from the individual departments and government organizations like the National AIIDS Control Organization so that the affected persons get speedy relief. It posted the case for an early hearing next month."

        "body": "HYDERABAD: A 19-year-old woman who was allegedly given HIV-infected blood at the time of her delivery filed a petition with the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Saturday seeking action against the Red Cross blood bank that had sold the infected blood to her husband. Her four-month-old son in tow, Shaik Haseena pleaded with SHRC authorities for relief saying that after she had tested positive, her husband Nisar Ahmed, a labourer, had abandoned her and the child. Based on her petition, SHRC has asked Ratna Kishore, principal secretary of the medical and heath department and Uma Maheshwar Rao, secretary to the State Red Cross Society, to file reports. Haseena\u2019s family had been instructed by staff at a private hospital in Nellore to arrange for three units of blood which her husband procured from the Red Cross Society. The delivery had to be done via Caesarean section and the blood was requisitioned since Haseena was anaemic. She was discharged a week later with mild fever. When the fever refused to subside even 15 days after she had returned home, her family members took her to the hospital where she underwent tests. The results revealed that she was HIV positive but since blood tests prior to the delivery showed her as HIV negative, doctors said that she might have got infected through the transfusion at the time of delivery. When family members approached the Red Cross Society, officials there denied having sold any blood to them. \u201cShe fed the child for 10 days. Tests are being conducted regularly on her son to know whether he, too, has been infected,\u201d said a relative of Haseena. Although the blood bank was sealed after the incident came to light, Haseena\u2019s travails are far from over. The tiffin centre her mother used to run has gone out of business since customers started staying away after the news of her being HIV positive became public, the relative said. Family members said that despite several requests to Nellore district collector D Sridhar, who is also the chairman of the Red Cross Blood Bank, no financial assistance has been extended nor any treatment arranged for Haseena whose health is deteriorating. However, a plot for a house and provision for the supply of 35 kilos of rice have been made. The SHRC order, issued on Saturday, states that a committee constituted to inquire into the incident has not submitted its report to the collector. The SHRC has now directed the district collector to furnish a copy of the report filed by the committee."

        "body": "SURAT: Her life had many twists and turns as she had to pass from the toughest struggle for inclusion and acceptance after facing discrimination in society when she was detected with HIV in 1997. At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples\u2019 perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country. Meet Daxa Patel, who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift. \u201cWhen my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,\u201d says 42-year-old Daxa. Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected. It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/\u00c1ID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003. The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc. \u201cWe used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,\u201d she said. Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government\u2019s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls. GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won\u2019t have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level."

        "body": "LONDON: Over 30 years after it first emerged and has since infected over 75 million people, scientists have finally pinpointed from where exactly HIV emerged. A genetic analysis of thousands of individual viruses has confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that HIV first emerged in Kinshasa, the capital of the Belgian Congo, in about 1920 from where it spread thanks to the colonial railway network to other parts of central Africa. Scientists have nailed the origin of the Aids pandemic to a colonial-era city \u2014 then called Leopoldville which was then the biggest urban centre in Central Africa including a market in wild \u201cbush meat\u201d captured from the nearby forests. A \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors then led to the virus\u2019 spread in the human population. UNAIDS estimates that 35 million people were living with HIV in the world at the end of 2013. Scientists from University of Oxford said, \u201cThirty years after the discovery of HIV-1, the early transmission, dissemination and establishment of the virus in human populations remain unclear. Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa (in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo) was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.\u201d Vendors sell their products beside a railroad track in Kinshasa, Zaire (File photo via Getty Images) The breakthrough was possible due to a new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations. The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys into humans, but only one \u2014 known has HIV-1 group M \u2014 sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers. \u201cFor the first time we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from,\u201d said Professor Oliver Pybus of Oxford University. \u201cThis means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.\u201d \u201cKinshasa at that time was growing fast, it was the biggest city in central Africa at that time and was very well connected to the rest of the Congo,\u201d said Nuno Faria of Oxford. \u201cData from colonial archives tells us that by the end of the 1940s over one million people were travelling through Kinshasa on the railways each year. Our genetic data tells us that HIV very quickly spread across Congo, a country the size of Western Europe,\u201d Dr Faria said. \u201cOur research suggests that following the original animal-to-human transmission of the virus, probably through the hunting or handling of bush meat, there was only a small window during the Belgian colonial era for this particular strain of HIV to emerge and spread into a pandemic,\u201d Professor Pybus said. \u201cBy the 1960s, transport systems such as the railways that enabled the virus to spread vast distances were less active, but by that time the seeds of the pandemic were already sown across Africa and beyond,\u201d he said."

        "body": "New Delhi: With HIV testing and treatment coverage at a meagre 36% leaving majority of those infected undetected or untreated, the Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea for setting up medical centres across the country, particularly in rural areas, exclusively to provide treatment to people suffering from the deadly virus. India has the third-highest number of people with HIV in the world with number of those infected by the deadly virus standing at 21.17 lakh. Although HIV epidemic in the country is slowing down with a 19% decline in new HIV infections (130,000 in 2013) and a 38% decline in AIDS-related deaths between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of people who do not have access to antiretroviral therapy treatment is still very high at around 64%. Agreeing to hear a PIL for setting up hospitals exclusively for treatment of HIV-infected patients in every district, a bench of Justices J S Khehar and C Nagappan issued notice to Centre seeking its response. The court passed the order on a petition filed by senior advocate Paramananda Katara who contended that every HIV- infected patient must be provided antiretroviral therapy at affordable price immediately after the diagnosis to stop the deadly virus from multiplying. At the end of 2013, only 7 lakh people were on antiretroviral therapy, the second largest number of people on such treatment in any country.\"Helpless patients suffering with HIV/AIDS are dying all over the country as there are no exclusive hospitals to deal with this disease. There are no HIV-testing centres in rural areas and it leads to spread of the virus. It is a fundamental duty of the Centre and state governments to provide immediate medical treatment to HIV/AIDS patients,\" he told the bench. Contending that prisoners and sex workers are more prone to being affected by the virus, the petitioner contended that testing centres must be set up in jail premises and red light areas.HIV prevalence in the country is estimated at 0.3%. This figure is small compared to most other middle-income countries in the world but because of huge population this equates to more than 21 lakh people living with HIV. Around 1.3 lakh people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2013."

        "body": "NAGPUR: Community care centres (CCCs) meant to serve People Living with HIV (PLHIV) across Maharashtra and Karnataka are facing a huge shortage of funds that has even forced a couple of them to close down. Others may well be on their way. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is supposed to fund these centres. In the two states, this is done by routing the money through Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT). Since April though, no money has come from NACO and despite many efforts, officials have not responded to NGOs and social workers associated with the centres. This has put a question mark on the future of 66 centres in both states. Many organizations running the CCCs have been spending their own money since the last few months and are no longer in a position to continue doing so. The centres provide anti-retroviral therapy to patients with provision for attending to in-patients as well as out-patients along with counselling. The first centre to provide these services in Pune's Sai Sneha Hospital has closed down. \"Ours is not a very big NGO so not much funds are available with us. We pulled on for about four months without NACO funds, but could not do it anymore so we decided to shut it,\" said Dr Sunil Jagtap from the hospital. Bhagwan Maske, who looks after the only CCC in Bhandara, is also facing similar difficulties. \"We need Rs 1.5 lakh every month. We have not paid our employees for half a year now and they say they want to leave. It would be impossible to run the centres if this situation continues,\" he said adding he was thinking of closing down the centre. KHPT officials said they have helped their partner institutions and tried resolving the issue to the best of their ability. \"Despite not getting any money from NACO, we have given Rs 50 lakh from to the centres that are in dire need to prevent them from shutting. We don't have enough funds with us for all as each centre needs at least Rs 1 lakh per month,\" Dr Mrunal Shetye, project director of KHPT in Maharashtra, said. \"We are in constant touch with NACO and are trying to resolve the issue at the earliest to prevent more centres from closing down,\" he added. He did not elaborate on what the issue holding back the funds was. He said his organization had approached NACO several times. \"KHPT was assigned to give funds for the last financial year. When the contract ended, there was no communication from NACO about discontinuing the arrangement, but the contract has not been renewed,\" informed Datta Patil, executive director of Youth for Unity & Voluntary Action (YUVA), that runs one such centre in the city. \"The money spent on the upkeep of the centres exceeds the funds provided most months. We bridge the gaps ourselves and have never raised the issue, but if no money is to be given at all, it would be difficult for us to run the centres,\" said Amruta Joshi of Bharatiya Aadim Jati Sevak Sangh. \"The money is donated by trusting people in the Global Fund against AIDS, TB & Malaria (GFATM) with the government being only a facilitator. I do not understand how they can stop the funds abruptly without any communication,\" said Deepesh Charles who takes care of the PHLIVs at Mure Memorial Hospital's CCC. The district programme officers of district AIDS prevention and control unit Ganesh Parihar from Nagpur and Sandeep Dhawale from Pune, though aware of the problem, said they were helpless as it was not under their jurisdiction. Efforts to contact NACO headquarters in Delhi were not successful."

        "body": "LONDON: Researchers have developed a female condom which they claim can protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV by dissolving inside the body and releasing chemicals. Besides blocking the sperm, the condom could time-release a potent mix of anti-HIV drugs and hormonal contraceptives, the \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 reported. Experts claim the \u2018discreet protection\u2019 can safeguard people from HIV and unwanted pregnancy by \u2018melting\u2019 inside the body. Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) developed the condom from tiny microfibres through a method called \u2018electrospinning\u2019 . The cloth-like fibres can be woven from medicine into extremely thin \u2018webs\u2019 . They are then designed to dissolve after use, either within minutes or over several days. The team was given $1 million to develop the technology, which uses an electric field to charge fluid through air to create the very fine , nanometre-sized fibres . \u201cOur dream is to create a product women can use to protect themselves from HIV and unintended pregnancy,\u201d Kim Woodrow, a UW assistant professor of bioengineering, said. \u201cWe have the drugs to do that.

With over 500 students expected to take part in it, the rally would start from the Ursula Horsman Hospital with Shikshak Park being the point of culmination. The rally is being organized by the UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) and district health department. The organizers will also set up counselling camps at various health centres in which experts will share information about HIV and AIDS. The doctors will also dispel myths in the counselling camp at UHM. There will be a debate and painting competition. Many students expressed their willingness to be associated with the HIV/AIDS awareness campaign and take part in the events schedule at UHM on November 30. Dr AK Saxena, District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO) and event coordinator said: \"Awareness at this stage will help students to protect themselves from HIV and AIDS.\" The first World AIDS Day came in the wake of the world summit of ministers of health on programmes for AIDS prevention. The event was held in London in January 1988 in which delegates from 148 countries took part. The participants emphasized the need for worldwide AIDS education, free exchange of information and the protection of human rights and dignity. \"The World Health Organization recognized the event by declaring December 1 as World AIDS Day. In 1991, the red ribbon became the international symbol of HIV and AIDS awareness. It was created by the Visual AIDS Caucus in New York,\" added Saxena."

The first AIDS case was detected in Goa in 1987 in a foreigner and in 1989 the first Goan case was detected. Total number of HIV cases detected in Goa since 1987 to 2014 (up to October) are 15,603. HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa and majority of the cases are reported in Salcete, Mormugao, Tiswadi and Bardez. The disease is more common in males than females. Out of every three cases detected, two are males."

After the intervention of the team, people living in the neighborhood and the landlord allowed the HIV positive children to stay in the present accommodation. The district administration team reached the Aanchal Care Home early morning and counselled residents of the area.

We have an agreement for two years. The landlord is also helping us a lot.\" He said that the visit by the district administration officials and the medical and health department made the difference. As the district administration interfered into the matter and resolved the issue, smiles are back on the faces of the HIV positive children. Earlier, RNP+ had written in an e-mail which was sent to TOI on Wednesday stating, \"Just after six days' stay in the present home at Bharat Marg, Hanuman Nagar, the house owner forced the children to vacate the house with immediate effect due to pressure from neighboring people.\" They had also met district collector Navin Mahajan asking him for a solution of the issue. The team of district administration officials, including ADM (South) Jaswant Singh and also chief medical and health officer (Jaipur) O P Thankan, along with policemen reached Bharat Marg in Hanuman Nagar and met the residents, housing complex society office bearers and neighbours to talk about the issue. Singh said office bearers of the society told them that they had never asked the children to leave. \"The neighbours told us that they are ready to help the children. They also told us that they did not ask the children to leave the house,\" he said. Thankan apprised the neighbours that stay of the children does not make them vulnerable. He also told them about the misconceptions of HIV/AIDS. Bharat Marg, where 19 HIV positive children, who have lost their parents, live is one of the posh areas of the city. Aanchal Care Home, has been running since May 2010, and shifted to a new accommodation on November 3 this year.

The case will be heard by Chief Justice J Chelameswar and Justice PR Ramachandra Menon on Wednesday. Foundation for Integrated Research in Mental Health, a voluntary health organization based at Thiruvananthapuram, has taken up the case of an HIV positive patient who was denied treatment by a private hospital at Thiruvananthapuram and is moving a petition before the high court challenging the stances taken by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) towards the treatment denial. Ashok Nair, who is HIV positive, was denied treatment when he was taken to Cosmopolitan hospital at Thiruvananthapuram after he suffered multiple fractures in a traffic accident. He was advised of the need for urgent surgery as he had suffered multiple fractures and was taken to the trauma care wing of the hospital. Ashok told the hospital staff that he was HIV positive. Upon learning that he was HIV positive, the hospital authorities denied to provide treatment to him and referred him to the Medical College Hospital of Thiruvananthapuram. Ashok approached the human rights commission questioning the hospital's denial of treatment. KSACS enquired into the incident and submitted a report that accepted the hospital's stance that the patient was sent back as he was in need of surgery for which the hospital didn't have facilities. When the petition by Ashok was considered by NHRC, it accepted KSACS' report and dismissed allegations of treatment denial.The petitioner alleges that the explanation by the hospital is not credible as their website boasts of a specialty clinic for orthopaedic and trauma care."

Named the \"Scouting Robotic Eye Ball\", the innovative surveillance equipment can prove useful for urban warfare or anti-terror activities. \"The eye ball can help carry out combing operations. It is as big as a cricket ball. Just throw it at any place and start the video surveillance,\" said a Chinese Military officer told TOI. The unit comes with a hand-held device and two eye balls. The electronic display of the hand-held unit can show images relayed by both the eye balls at the same time. The equipment can also help launch simultaneous searches in two different areas.\" Terrorist activities are taking over traditional wars. Most terror threats are urban centric. There is a need for compact surveillance systems like this ball to counter new-age security threats,\" said an Indian army official, adding that Indian scientists too are working on equipment targeted at urban warfare. Surveillance drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are part of the experiments, the official added. \"The eye ball gives the exact picture of happenings in troubled areas, thus helping reduce collateral damage and civilian casualties. Contingency plans can be drafted properly and implemented effectively,\" said the official. A Chinese official said the eye ball is made of thick rubber among other materials. It has one high-resolution video camera, which can be operated using a remote. The ball can start sharing video footage as soon as it is thrown at the targeted area. The ball can rotate 360 degrees which helps it gather detailed information. The range of the camera is 200 meters, which with obstacles, could get reduced to 50 meters. \"The Chinese security agencies have tried and tested this technology. They are using it for around two years. It has been really helpful in reaching places that pose threat to human life,\" said a Chinese official."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Foreigners coming to get a look and feel of \"Incredible India\" won't be required to declare their HIV status while filling their visa forms. India has lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients. In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that reference to a mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies and consulates failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) sent an email to all its embassies and consulates, clarifying that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India. MEA has asked all offices to remove the requirement for HIV test from all visa forms available with Indian Embassies and Consulates. The action was prompted by a parliamentary question on April 15 by Dr E M Sudarsana Natchiappan, MP and a member of the Forum of Parliamentarians on HIV and AIDS (FPA). Welcoming the initiative, Oscar Fernandes, MP and president of FPA, said, \"I am pleased that India has clarified its position to lift HIV-related travel restrictions.\" J D Seelam, MP and general secretary FPA, said, \"We welcome the step taken by MEA as globally there are ambiguities about India's standing on travel regulations based on HIV status.\" Dr Natchiappan added, \"We commend the leadership displayed by the Indian government. FPA believes that these types of travel restrictions limit the rights of people living with HIV and fuel discrimination and stigma.\" Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive. Stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming. Official data shows that 66 countries deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals -- of these nations, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay. \"These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic,\" said Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. Union health secretary K Sujatha Rao believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. \"In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,\" she pointed out. Dr Charles Gilks, UNAIDS country coordinator, said such regulations were issued by many countries in the 1980s when little was known about HIV, and there was more of confusion and fear about the virus. Globally, there is no evidence that such restrictions prevent HIV transmission or protect public health. MEA's move upholds India's commitment to human rights and dignity of all people including those living with HIV. A WHO statement pointed out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. \"They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,\" said the statement. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades-old travel laws against HIV-positive patients."

Society officials said the healthy trend was facilitated by various service centres functioning under it such as Jyothis the integrated counselling and testing centres, Ushas the anti-retroviral therapy centres, Pulari that gives free treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases, Suraksha that targets HIV-prone groups, voluntary blood donation centres and red ribbon clubs in educational institutions. Health minister V S Sivaku mar, while inaugurating the AIDS Day observance at VJT Hall here, also hailed the concerted effort by various organizations in this regard. \"The efficient implementation of various programmes by the health department and organizations like KSACS has helped bring down the number of people living with HIV,\" he said.

        "body": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) has decided to go with 4th generation Elisa test, instead of nucleic acid-based test, to detect HIV in the window period. A study conducted by the society has found that the Elisa test was more effective than nucleic test. HIV screening had become a matter of concern following the detection of the virus in a kid, who underwent blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre. Now, National AIDS Control Organisation has informed that it would supply Elisa test kits to the state. \"For the time being, we have supplied enough kits to all government medical college hospitals and Regional Cancer Centre. Moreover, Kerala State Medical Services Corporation (KMSCL) has also been asked to procure the kits, which will be supplied to all the blood banks and hospitals with blood banks,'' said Dr R Ramesh, managing director of KSACS. As per the study, in the nucleic test the virus could not be detected even for a week after the blood is collected. \"But Elisa test gives more accurate result even during the first one week window period,'' said Dr Ramesh. In the past one year, KSACS collected 4 lakh blood units, of which 300 were detected with HIV using the third generation Elisa test. \"In the past four years, we might have collected about 25 lakh blood units and only in one case it has gone undetected (in the RCC incident). Hence our testing facilities are accurate. With this 4th generation test, we can assure 100% safety and accuracy,'' he pointed out. Now, KSACS has decided to go for a wide-spread campaign for voluntary blood donation since it is the only safe way for collecting the blood units. \"We have achieved only 60% in voluntary blood donation and the remaining is still replacement blood donation. The latter is always risky,'' he said. Catch 25, a campaign to encourage youths in the age group 18 to 25 for voluntary blood donation will be launched by KSACS. \"We have found that most of high-risk groups are above 30 years and hence it would be safe if we could promote voluntary blood donation among youngsters below 25 years,'' said Dr Ramesh."

But their systems have been battling the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) right from birth. Sneha Care Home makes all efforts to ensure their dreams are not crippled. Though HIV is an increasingly thriving menace in our society, little thought is spared for children who suffer after their parents fall victim to it. For no fault of their's, they are left to face the extreme bitterness of living with the disease. With treatment options expanding, issues about their future get more complex. Sneha Care Home (SCH) stepped in to address these issues. Started on July 14, 2008, SCH and Shining Star School address multiple issues of children infected with HIV, as well as prepare them for a productive and constructive life. \"Now with treatment options increasing dramatically, the life span of HIV-infected has also gone up, making us think of their future too,\" says Fr Mathew Perumpil, director of Sneha Care Home. \"When they grow up and become sexually active, they become potentially dangerous in transmitting the virus. Initially, we used to send our children to nearby schools. Once a teacher in the school noticed one of our boys growing intimate with a girl from his class and alerted us. We were totally unprepared to handle such a situation. That is when we started this new venture with 20 children where they are given value-based education,\" he adds. Now SCH houses 83 children who are below 12 years of age, including 34 girls. Most of them were orphaned due to the deadly HIV and many are with single parent. \"We choose kids from houses where the environment is not conducive for their healthy growth. We take away the burden of bringing up the children from suffering families,\" says Perumpil. Children are educated at the Shining Star School on their premises which ensures a good value system. The school, based on National Open School Curriculum, focuses on encouraging creativity and auditing the aptitude of these children. \"We want them to enter a good profession which is less physically taxing and that will define their self-esteem to live a life full of hope and meaning,\" says Perumpil. The tiny bundles of energy who run around here prove these points. With a smile on their lips and stars in their eyes, they are surging ahead in life. Ten-year-old Varalakshmi wants to become a nurse when she grows up. Ask her why: \"I want to take care of others,\" she quips. Puneet Kumar, 11, wants to be a farmer and is already willing to look after the vegetable garden at SCH. To ensure that these kids don't miss anything in life, SCH sends them to foster homes for holidays. \"We identify and screen the family before sending the children,\" says Perumpil. With all the care and affection from SCH, these children are better equipped to face their future with a smile."

In reality the picture is more shocking. It is said that 70 percent of the AIDS budget is spent on awareness. Where is the money going? It is shameful that even after close to 30 years of the AIDS scourge only 9.4 percent of women are aware about it,\" said Jahnabi Goswami, AIDS activist and the first women in the region to publicly declare her HIV positive status.Even though Assam is categorised as a low HIV prevalence state the annual HIV new infections has risen at an rate of 2.5 percent from 1219 in 2007 to 2408 in 2011. Till 31st December, 2014 a total of 9991 HIV positive cases were detected out of which 3445 were females.States like Bihar and Meghalaya with 10.1 percent and 13.3 percent respectively haven't performed well either when it came to women having comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS.\"There is an acute shortage of manpower and resource in the health department overseeing HIV/AIDS scenario in the state. The figure appears shocking and it is not good. It needs serious thinking and introspection to do. There has been an ongoing fund crunch for AIDS from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO),\" said a source at the health department.Till September, 2015 38 percent of HIV positive cases were detected from Kamrup (metro) followed by Cachar, Dibrugarh, Nagaon districts. From Kamrup (metro) district alone 4268 HIV positive cases were detected till September, 30, 2015. The rate of increase in annual new HIV infections is highest in Assam and Tripura."

It will be voluntary for the two-crore-plus workforce in private establishments and factories to undergo HIV test, but the policy will ensure that no one faces stigma or is given the pink slip if tested positive. The policy may also pave the way for employees to receive financial support from their employers for treatment, which is expensive. Stating that the policy will be introduced in three months, Maharshtra labour secretary Kavita Gupta said, \"We are fine-tuning a policy that will ensure that there is no discrepancy to any of the person with HIV at his workplace. It will provide employment and social security to HIV-positive persons.\" Labour minister Hasan Mushrif said, \"Many of the unions requested the labour department to conduct HIV test for the labourers. The proposal is under consideration. The decision is yet to be taken on the issue.\" Incidentally, the first case of AIDS was reported in Mumbai in 1986. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), 14 districts of Maharashtra figure in the all-India list of 49 districts with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. There are nearly two crore labourers (excluding farm and domestic workers) in Maharashtra. According to the state labour department, it will be mandatory for all the factories and establishments to adopt the HIV-friendly workplace policy. However, it will be the labourer's discretion whether he/she wants to undergo an HIV test. Those workers who opt for the HIV check-up and test positive can avail the benefit of the policy. \"Those who do not turn up for the check-up will be deprived of the benefits,\" said a health official. Justifying department's move, Gupta said, \"The aim is not to get information on number of HIV-afflicted labourers. Its aim is to provide financial stability (employment) and social security to those who test positive.\" She said the introduction of the policy will help earlier detection of HIV. \"Earlier the detection, better the chances of healthy survival of the victim,\" said Gupta."

On Thursday, he was again targeted by a group near his house. The victim then called up city police. When police did not turn up, his relative sought help from social activists. Police came to the spot only after the mob started growing at the spot. Finally, police registered cross-complaints and arrested the man along with four others from the spot for assault. \"We have taken an assurance from the society residents that there will be no more harassment in the future. We have told them that if there is any repetition of this, they will be booked for criminal offence,\" said a Vatva police official after the incident. The man however decided to approach senior police authorities to represent his case."

        "body": "RAIPUR: In a blatant case of discrimination against HIV patients, the staff of Dr BR Ambedkar Hospital here put up a hand written notice of \u201cUniversal precautions\u201d on the bedside of a HIV positive women and her newly born child, who incidentally has yet not been confirmed to be suffering from the disease. The woman (identity withheld), who delivered the child on July 2, was shocked to find the notice put up by her bedside and the cradle for the baby in a ward (No. 4), which had 24 other women. The humiliation of the couple did not end with the just the notice, as the staff kept addressing the women as \u201cHIV walli\u201d instead of her name. Recounting what he termed as \u201chumiliating days\u201d, the husband said while the staff in the ward addressed all the women with their first names, my wife was called \u201cHIV walli\u201d. He said his requests to the staff to refrain from doing so made no difference and they were made to feel \u201coutcastes\u201d in the ward. Though at present there are no comprehensive laws in India to deal with the menace of discrimination with HIV/AIDS infected people and their rights, India is signatory to various international treaties and agreements that provide for protection and non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease. In fact two legislations, the HIV/AIDS Bill 2007 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014, which provide for non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease, are pending clearance in the Parliament. Dubbing the act of the BR Ambedkar hospital staff as \u201cillegal\u201d, experts point out that a HIV positive person has the right to keep his/her HIV/AIDS status confidential. They say that even Courts have upheld that that in case HIV patients do not want to disclose their identity, they can use a pseudonym before even the Courts to suppress their identity. A leading lawyer pointed out that the Bombay High court had ruled that the court would permit HIV positive litigant to suppress his or her identity and prosecute or defend the proceedings under an assumed name. \u201cWhen the law is clear, then why isn\u2019t it followed in the hospital\u201d, questioned Rinki Arora, president of Chhattisgarh Network of positive. Admitting that it could be in the interest of the staff to know that an individual is an HIV patient, Rinki said the status of the individual could be mentioned on their health sheets and the prescriptions rather than publically declaring her status by putting put a poster and addressing her as \u201cHIV walli\u201d. Rinki said moreover, the infant has yet not be tested for the disease as the same could be conducted only after two months and the subsequent process for confirming the actual status of HIV could take up to 18 months. \u201cThe hospital staff has already branded the child HIV positive by the poster on the side of the cradle\u201d, she said. Advocacy officer of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion trust, Amruta Alpesh Soni, who also visited the hospital, said the staff cannot disclose the identity of an HIV patient and it had violated the NACO guidelines by doing so. When contacted, hospital\u2019s public relation officer, Shubhra, said the staff put up the \u201cuniversal precaution\u201d notice to make duty nurses aware of the patient\u2019s status. She however, admitted that it was wrong to address the patient by her HIV status and the administration would look into it."

        "body": "New Delhi: In a rare surgery, doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital recently performed a liver transplant on an HIV positive person. The patient, a 45-year-old man from northeast, has been living with HIV since 2003. He contracted Hepatitis C leading to liver failure. The family of the patient said the local hospitals they approached had given up, saying there was no cure for this complex condition. So, they rushed him to Delhi where the transplant was carried out. \u201cIt took us over 10 hours to carry out the life-saving procedure. We had to be very careful not to catch the infection. At the same time, we had to ensure that the patient didn\u2019t contract any infection post transplant,\u201d said Dr Naimish Mehta, senior liver transplant surgeon at SGRH. He said HIV patients are generally not taken up for major surgeries, particularly transplants, because they are immune-compromised. \u201cIn this case, for example, the patient had both HIV and Hepatitis C, which compromised his immunity significantly. Additionally, we had to suppress his immune system post transplant to ensure that the body doesn\u2019t reject the new liver,\u201d Mehta said. The liver transplant surgeon added that this was a huge challenge for them and any misstep could have proved fatal. The liver transplant surgeon said both the donor and the recipient were doing well. In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV and Hepatitis C virus co-infection, said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, department of gastroenterology at the hospital. He added that initially HIV infection was considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplants because of concerns about disease progression. However, with recent advances in retro-viral therapy for HIV and treatment for Hepatitis C virus infection, complex procedures, including transplants, can be carried out, the doctor added. The US Congress recently passed HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act), which allows organ donation between HIV positive individuals. \u201cThe prevalence of liver disease in patients with HIV is higher than that of the general population, as are the morbidity and mortality. But with successful transplant, it is possible to give them a new life,\u201d Arora added. According to the doctor, in India, the biggest hurdle for patients suffering from HIV is the stigma associated with this disease. In many areas, HIV positive people are considered social outcasts. Worse, they are turned away by many hospitals too. \u201cIn spite of medical advances, these patients find themselves condemned for life,\u201d said another senior doctor at Gangaram hospital."

Nearly onethird of PLHIV in Telangana reside in Hyderabad and unscientific administration of drugs will complicate the fight against HIV and Aids. According to HIV rights activists in the city, while antiretroviral treatment is scientifically proved, homoeopathic drugs for HIV are yet to be medically tested. About 1,000 people with HIVAids from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are now treated by homoeopaths at the government JSPS College of Homeopathy in Hyderabad. \u201cIt is a cause of concern that homoeopathic medicines are given without a scien tific backing,\u201c said Mujtaba Hasan Askari of Helping Hand Foundation (HHF). He told STOI that the HHF recently conducted a survey in Telangana and found that homoeopathic drugs are prescribed to people with HIV and Aids. \u201cAbout 1,000 HIVAids cases from Telangana and other states have taken recourse to alternative medicine (homoeopathy). The homoeopathy drugs are given free of cost every Monday and Thursday at the JSPS College of Homeopathy between 9.30am and 1.30pm in a well-organised camp on the sprawling hospital premises at Ramanthapur,\u201c Askari said expressing fears that drugs not backed by sound clinical trials may only aggravate the problem and increase the burden of disease. \u201cThis is a disaster in waiting,\u201c he added. Doctors warn that if antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is discontinued there is a high risk of resistance to first line ARV drugs. This will be difficult to diagnose and treat the disease. Only a few trained clinicians can diagnose ARV first line resistance and only a small number of ART plus centres can administer second line treatment to HIVAids cases. He said though homoeopathy drugs are given free of cost, the patients are referred to diagnostic centres to get their CD4 count tested. Those with HIV and Aids are forced to spend money on diagnostic tests while similar tests are conducted free of cost in government hospitals and designated ART centres."

        "body": "MUMBAI: Two alleged suicides of HIV-TB patients in a span of 45 days at Sewri TB Hospital have put the spotlight back on the need for counsellors at the city's biggest TB hospital. Shockingly, the hospital that treats over 850 patients at any given point of time does not have a single full-time counsellor. On Monday, an HIV-positive woman, who was admitted to the hospital, about 10 days ago for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR) treatment allegedly jumped off the lift duct on the first floor of the hospital. Her brother and his wife had paid her a visit just a few hours before she allegedly committed suicide. The autopsy report showed that she died of head injury. On February, it was a 19-year-old boy from Bandra who slashed his wrist after he could no longer bear to go through the long-drawn treatment regime. \"MDRTB treatment lasts for up to two years during which the patient can suffer from adverse effects ranging from nausea, deafness, blindness, among other things. The patient needs to be constantly motivated to take the medicines,\" a senior public health official said. Currently, there is only one counsellor from Medicine Sans Frontiers visiting the Sewri hospital. tnn \"Counselling should be made mandatory for resistant TB cases. They suffer from extreme mood swings. Most of them endure enormous financial and personal hardships that inadvertently affect their treatment,\" said a senior doctor from the TB hospital. The TB Hospital is already reeling under vacancies. For instance, only eleven assistant medical officer posts out of 27 are filled up. The hospital is running without two of its deputy medical superintendents. A BMC official, however, said that the situation will soon change. \"Sewri TB Hospital will get four counsellors for its DOTS plus centres and so will KEM, Nair and Sion hospitals. The posts have already been sanctioned from the centre under the Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP),\" the official said."

The matter has been referred to the protection officer of Yamunanagar district's special cell for women and child department. According to the one-page complaint filed by the woman with the authorities concerned , who has been married for 10 years and is in her early thirties, her husband got infected with HIV \"due to his extra-marital relationships\". She has also stated that her husband doesnot bother about the presence of children before \"making such demands\". The complaint further stated that it had become routine for her husband to behave indecently before their two children under the influence of liquor. \"He has been insisting on intercourse, and whenever I object to it, he does not hesitate to thrash me. It has become traumatic for me to live with him under such circumstances.... It seems he has lost his mind and does not even bother [about] the presence of children while making such demands,\" the complainant has submitted. The complainant has requested that she should be rescued from her husband's tortuous behaviour so that she doesn't get HIV. Arvinderjit Kaur, who holds the charge of protection officer of Yamunanagar district, told TOI that police have forwarded the complaint to her office to resolve the issue through mediation and conciliation. She has summoned both for talks on Monday to find some way out. \"This is a personal dispute and we will try to resolve it by involving both parties. If the meeting does not work out, the woman would be open to file a police complaint against her husband for domestic violence or other related charges,\" Kaur added. She stated that they cannot ask her to start living separately or seek divorce, but can counsel her husband not to force himself on her."

The HIV/AIDS positive rate in the state, however, is at an all time low, even as the number of people testing for HIV/AIDS is the highest ever. Between 1986 and 2011, over three lakh persons have undergone the test to check for their HIV status in Goa. Of these, 13,913 individuals have tested HIV positive and 1,453 have resulted in AIDS cases to date. The number of male AIDS patients in Goa, between 1986 and 2011, has been more than double at 1,009 of the 444 females detected with the ailment. The highest number of HIV positive cases were reported in Goa in 2007. The number of cases came down to 1,019 in the following year and to 959 in 2009. Last year, the HIV positive cases came further down to 821 and to 459 this year till August. The positivity rate has also come down from 13.41% in the late '90s to 4.77% in 2007 and just 1.86% in 2011 so far. The number of persons testing for HIV, however, has grown exponentially from just 2,279 in 1995 to as much as 18,380 by 2006. The number went up further to 26,737 in 2008 and touched an all time high in the following year to 33,473. In the present year, already 24,691 persons have tested for HIV up to August. This increase in numbers can be attributed to increased awareness of the ailment brought about through state and central government efforts. Over the years, the Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has set up Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTCs) in three private hospitals in addition to 14 ICTCs operational in government hospitals. An ICTC is where a person goes for counseling and testing for HIV. The person comes entirely of his/her own will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The ICTCs provide HIV testing with pre-test and post-test counseling, drugs for opportunistic infections, free distribution of condoms and follow-up counseling for HIV positive cases through field visits. The centres also provide testing, pre-test and post-test counseling to pregnant mothers who come for ante-natal check ups. Those who test positive are provided psycho-social support and linked to treatment and care."

The conference is also supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations and will have government policy makers, social activists, health experts and students from across the globe attending the conference. \"I have never travelled outside the country and this is the first time I am getting an opportunity to travel to the state. I am sure it will be a good learning experience,\" said Narayanasamy. Nithyanandam Narayanasamy has been a member of the International AIDS society since 2008 and has been actively involved in spreading awareness about the disease and the rehabilitation of infected people who have to tackle the social stigma too. Initially, he was employed as a worker with Lakshmi Machine Works and at present he has a thermal flask selling outlet near Ondipudur in the city. Along with some like minded individuals, he formed a social collective called Thiyana social service centre to expand their social work. The district administration of Coimbatore has also felicitated Narayanasamy on numerous occasions for his work. \"The district AIDS society had issued an order in 2002 and I travelled across Coimbatore and visited more than 100 colleges and higher education centres to spread awareness about AIDS infection. I conducted more than 400 awareness camps across the district,\" Narayanasamy added. Narayanasamyu decided to join the International AIDS Conference to widen his network of social activities and also get in touch with similar work which is being carried out in other countries. Narayanasamy claimed that he had sent scanned copies of the certificates of appreciation from district administration and private social welfare organisations to the International AIDS Society and he got selected as a delegate for the conference. The travel expenses have to be borne by the delegates themselves but the remaining expenses will be borne by the society. He will leave for Delhi from Coimbatore on July 14 and will fly to Washington via Frankfurt on July 16. \"It is a good opportunity and also matter of pride to be part of such an international gathering of social workers and policy makers in the United States,\" said R Raveendran, honorary secretary, Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (RAAC). Narayanasamy had also been actively involved in the rehabilitation program of Tsunami victims and had also visited Bhuj in Gujarat as part of the relief work after the massive earthquake in 2001. Narayanasamy and a group of few like minded individuals in the city had collected medicines worth more than Rs 3 lakh to be sent to Gujarat through the Coimbatore district administration, he added."

Last year, no new cases of the immune deficiency syndrome were identified among those tested. There are 1,691 HIV positive people in Ernakulam as against a total of 26,242 in the state. The men, who are natives of Assam and Bihar, belong to high-risk groups and have lived in other metro cities before coming to Kerala, said NGOs who are monitoring them. It is learnt that the man from Assam has already left the state but he is in touch with NGO staff working in the area. Sapna Raj who is the project manager of Suraksha, a sexual health programme of KSACS, works with migrant groups in Perumbavoor to monitor the prevalence of AIDS said the organization has tied up with local industries to help organize awareness classes. \u201cThere is an issue of social stigma associated with AIDS. So we gradually bring the person into our system by keeping constant touch with them over phone. We make sure that they don\u2019t disappear and get lost in the crowd,\u201d she said. However, there are instances in which individuals themselves reveal their HIV status. In one case, an employee working with a textile shop showed his blood report result to a colleague, leading to his removal from the job. Depressed, the man just vanished. We don\u2019t know where he is now,\u201d said another NGO worker. Perumbavoor, which has a large population of domestic migrants, is under the scanner of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) owing to the rising number of men from West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Assam who live together in the area. As many as 10 people shack up in a single living unit. Many are yet to bring in their families. Their lack of hygiene is also a cause for concern. They too are monitored under Suraksha. Apart from intravenous drug users, two new groups \u2013 transgenders and truckers \u2013 are also being tested at several camps, officials said. \u201cWe have made the facility of a doctor available in these camps. The truckers are being tested at Palakkad and Ernakulam,\u201d said Binu George, project officer, technical support unit, Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS).

        "body": "KOLHAPUR: The state AIDS control society has conducted awareness and medical check-up camps for almost 50,000 sugarcane cutters in Kolhapur from December 1 to date. The camps were part of a pilot project of the Union government. It was to be implemented first in Kolhapur and then replicated at other places. The project, however, could be formally launched only on Wednesday. The sugarcane farmers' agitation for better prices from factories had delayed it. The Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) could, however, successfully 'cover' the 50,000 sugarcane workers. Those found to have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been counselled and administered medicines free of cost. Kolhapur district, known as the sugar bowl of India, has 22 cooperative and private sugar factories. At least two lakh sugarcane cutters from Marathwada come to these factories to work on contract basis. The factories sign them up the workers for four or five months. The workers come in October and stay till the end of the cutting season in May the next year. They operate in groups and are on the move from one farm to the other for the harvest. Some of the men take their wives along. Many of the workers go to roadside female sex workers from whom they get infected. Also, the sugarcane farms are located close to main roads and national highways. After the day's work, the workers go to highway food joints and look for sex workers. Some of them also have casual sex with women workers on sugarcane farms and the infection spreads further, said an officer on the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) project. Chief executive officer of the Kolhapur Zilla Parishad Vijay Suryavanshi on Wednesday spoke to a gathering of factory workers at Gurudutt Sugars Ltd in Kolhapur district's Shirol tehsil. A function was held there to launch the Union government initiative. The CEO told TOI, \"We have conducted a meeting with the managing directors of sugar factories in Kolhapur and have sensitized them on the importance of the programme. The identities of the HIV patients are not disclosed. They have to take the medicines that have been given to them and take some precautions so that the infection is not spread.\" The overall approach to AIDS is still not broad enough, so it would help if the check-up camps are held at the sugar factories, the CEO said. Mobile units have been used in the awareness and health check-up camps. The MSACS has also instructed the civil hospital and the district health department to participate in the drive. Three NGOs, too, are assissing the MSACS in he project. \"Sugarcane cutters were never specifically covered under the AIDS protection project. To get the exact picture of the community, we decided to extend the project to the as many sugar factories in the district as possible. We have communicated with the agriculture department, sugar factories, the civil hospital and the district health department regarding the project. It started little late because of the agitation for higher sugarcane purchase price,\" Jagdish Patil, regional programme officer of MSACS, told TOI on Wednesday. \"The biggest challenge is to conduct health check-ups of this migrant community. It is a high-risk population and we are creating information material for them. We have received lists of the number of labourers from each sugar factory; awareness programmes will be scheduled accordingly,\" said Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer, Kolhapur district AIDS control and prevention unit. In 2013, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) had decided to focus on migrant labourers and had chosen Kolhapur for its pilot project. In its earlier intervention missions, NACO had concentrated on truck drivers in a nationwide campaign. They were identified as a vulnerable group. Labourers who migrate for work, especially in brick kilns and hotels, were also targeted in an awareness drive."

In an article written in the PLOS ONE journal, they have said that they have identified some good bacteria'' that could protect women from HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections. A press release put out online by the university said they had identified the good bacteria after growing vaginal skin cells outside the body and studying the way they interacted with \"good and bad\" bacteria. \"The health of the human vagina depends on a symbiotic/mutually beneficial relationship with \"good\" bacteria that live on its surface feeding on products produced by vaginal skin cells. These good bacteria, in turn, create a physical and chemical barrier to bad bacteria and viruses including HIV,'' said the release. The research team, led by Richard Pyles, said they discovered that certain bacterial communities alter the way HIV infects and replicates. In their current studies, a bacterial community associated with a symptomatic condition called bacterial vaginosis substantially reduced the antiviral activity of one of the leading anti-HIV medicines. Conversely, vaginal surfaces occupied by healthy bacteria and treated with the antiviral produced significantly less HIV than those vaginal surfaces without bacteria treated with the same antiviral."

        "body": "PUNE: Performing routine activities like cooking, bathing and walking may become difficult for an HIV-infected person if treatment is delayed, a first of-its-kind study has found. The five-year-long study, conducted by the Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego, found that people with HIV/ AIDS in India are at higher risk of developing milder neuro-cognitive impairment if treatment is not initiated. The study was completed in May this year. The study has indicated a higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro-cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to take treatment. Neurocognitive impairment affects cognition (thinking), motor control (body movements) and the psychological state of the individual. The world over, people with HIV infection are living longer and having a better quality of life due to greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thanks to ART, HIV induced illnesses like cryptococal meningitis have been on the decline. However, conditions like HIV-associated neuro-cognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent. The study also assumes significance as earlier studies in the western world were based on the subtype B virus that causes HIV infection. However, in India, clade C is the most common subtype. Based on its characteristics, clade C has been found to affect an individual\u2019s nervous system less severely than other subtypes. It was milder than the subtype B prevalent in Europe and America, researchers say. \u201cThe baseline finding of the study suggests that clinicians and healthcare providers must know if people living with HIV have any difficulties with cognition or performing daily activities. The family members or the caregivers should also be told of such conditions so that they can detect changes in the individual and seek timely advice from healthcare providers,\u201d researcher Manisha Ghate, co-principal investigator of the study, told TOI on Thursday. Ghate said, \u201cThe routine activities of HIV-infected people may get affected if they have neuro-cognitive impairment. In milder forms, it may be prominent only while performing complex tasks like calculations and multitasking. But it is pronounced in severe forms like dementia and patients may have difficulty even in performing routine daily activities like cooking, bathing and walking. Cognitive impairment associated with HIV has been correlated with the increased complaints of job performance difficulties and poor medication adherence.\u201d Researcher Sanjay Mehendale, the principal investigator of the study, said, \u201cThe beneficial effect of ART has been observed in cognitively impaired individuals. The improvement was seen in the domains of learning, executive functioning and motor performance. This beneficial effect was also observed in cognitively impaired individuals with higher CD4 counts.\u201d Even otherwise, healthy people show neurological decline as they age. \u201cBut here we have a younger population infected with HIV, so this effect will be greater as they age. Patients need counselling in addition to ART,\u201d Ghate said. When contacted, NARI director Ramesh Paranjape said, \u201cThis is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.\u201d Why the study? People with HIV infection are living longer and better due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy. Though neurological opportunistic infections are on decline, non opportunistic conditions like HIV associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) remain prevalent. It has been shown that the impaired cognitive performance can affect routine activities, employment, adherence to treatment and quality of life. The studies have been conducted globally, but the data on the prevalence and co-factors associated with HAND available from systematically conducted research in India is scanty. Study details This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego.The study was initiated in September 2008 and completed recently in May 2013. The study was conducted in adult population above 18 years of age.The data was collected in three groups: 1) HIV infected individuals with advanced disease (CD4 count less than 200 cells/cmm) : [number of patients were 125], 2) HIV infected individuals with CD4 count between 350-550 cells/cmm : [number of patients were 128] and 3) HIV uninfected individuals [number of patients were 287]. All participants received a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, neuromedical assessment and laboratory evaluation.The neuropsychological test battery that was used in this study was developed at HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) San Diego and standardized in Indian population prior to useAfter baseline evaluations, all individuals with CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 received ART treatment as per the national guidelines and nearly 50% HIV individuals with CD4 count between 350 and 550 cells/mm3 were given immediate antiretroviral treatment (they were co enrolled from a ongoing clinical trial). The participants were followed every year for neuropsychological evaluation. The cognitive battery included tests in the domain of fluency, speed of information processing, attention, executive functioning,learning, memory and motor performance. The outcome on ART was evaluated based on the performance in these tests. In the offing Indian Council of Medical Research has organised national seminar on \u2018NeuroAIDS in India: Current Findings and Future Directions\u2019 at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune on September 24 and September 25. (Source: National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune) Key findings of nari study A study has indicated higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to be put on treatment The most common subtype clade C, which causes HIV infection in India, has been found to affect nervous system less severely than subtypes like subtype B virus prevalent in Europe, America."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Deaths caused by AIDS declined nearly 55% in India in the past eight years, whereas new HIV infections came down by 66% since 2000. In 2007, India had recorded 1,48,309 such deaths; in 2015, the figure stood at just 67,600, according to latest statistics presented by health minister J P Nadda at an ongoing high-level United Nations meeting in New York. The conclave is evaluating the implementation of the UN AIDS control programme. Globally, such deaths declined 41% between 2005 to 2015.Between 2000 and 2015, new HIV infections in India dropped from 2.51 lakh to 86,000 - compared with a global fall of just 35%.The UN General Assembly has proposed to fast-track implementation of AIDS control strategies to end the epidemic across the world by 2030. Endorsing the proposal, Nadda said countries must adopt the target and collaboratively work to achieve it.Highlighting the importance of affordable medicines to tackle the prevalence of AIDS and India's role in making such drugs available worldwide, Nadda asked the UN to ensure global access to affordable medicines.India, which faced the spectre of disastrous consequences on account of AIDS epidemic 15 years back, has been able to manage the challenge effectively,\" Nadda told the UN meeting. \"Targeted interventions based on close collaboration and empowerment of communities and civil society with appropriate funding from the government have helped deliver key life saving services to the affected population,\" Nadda said. Seeking higher investment from international public health agencies to end the epidemic, Nadda said, \"The role of international assistance and cooperation cannot be underestimated. This is the time for developed countries to do more, not less, and enhance their commitments. We cannot afford to give the epidemic a chance to rebound.\" The National AIDS Control Programme has been walking a tightrope with international funds drying up over the last three years. This has led to fears about recurrence of new HIV cases. Estimates show a reduction of almost 90% in funding from various multilateral, bilateral and philanthropic donor organisations over the last three years. The government is, therefore, trying hard to seek continuous funding for the programme as it is currently at a critical juncture. Indian firms like Cipla and Dr Reddy's Laboratories supply 80% of the generic drugs used worldwide for treatment of AIDS. However, many of them have been facing tough regulations in several countries because of patent litigations."

        "body": "MANDYA: Whether it is because HIV tests have been made mandatory for pregnant women under prevention-of-mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme in government hospitals or the fact that youths are getting promiscuous, the rise in HIV positive cases is causing concern among the medical fraternity. According to Vinayak, supervisor of District AIDS Preventive and Control Unit, between 2002 and November 2011, a total of 9,883 HIV+ cases were detected. \"In 2010, 894 positive cases were detected, while in 2011 up to November, 942 cases were detected. Though the number of HIV+ cases detected in Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) has come down, the overall number of cases detected under PMTCT and HIV+ positive cases has gradually increased,\" he said. Dr Rekha, working at the Retroviral Treatment Centre (ART), said that after the HIV test was made mandatory for mothers in government hospitals, they found that there were a growing number of HIV+positive cases. \"This is because married women are the real victims of spouses who stray,\" she added. According to statistics available at the ART centre, 281 persons affected with AIDS have died between 2009 and 2010 in Mandya district, and 3,299 HIV+ cases were detected in the same period. \"We are collecting and codifying 2011\u2019s data of HIV+ cases,\" Rekha said. She said the mandatory HIV test for pregnant women and mothers under the PMTCT programme has become an effective tool in unearthing more HIV positive cases. This detective mechanism is good for two reasons. \"By this, we can easily identify a HIV+ pregnant woman during the prenatal visit and it will also help us to protect the child from being infected with HIV through the ART,\" she said. PMTCT has shown gradual increase on the graph of HIV+ cases. \"If there is no such detection mechanism in government hospitals, HIV in pregnant women would otherwise go undetected and their babies are at higher risk of being infected,\" Rekha added."

        "body": "KOLKATA: More than 3,000 HIV-infected children including scores in Kolkata could be going untreated and uncared for in West Bengal, risking transmission of the deadly virus, with the state health authorities not even being aware of their existence. Around 150 of Kolkata's 11,000 streetchildren are infected with AIDS but have never been treated or screened, showed a recent study conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases. Aged less than 14, the majority of them who have acquired the disease from their mothers could die before they turn 18 or even earlier. The alarming facts have been disclosed following the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society's (WBSAPCS) response to an RTI application. The body has put the number of HIV+ children in the state at 684, including just 50 in Kolkata. Prantakatha, the NGO which filed the RTI application, has pointed out that more than 200 infected children have been traced in Kolkata alone. While the WBSAPCS claimed that their data has been compiled through various local networks and social organizations working at the grassroots with HIV+ people, Prantakatha alleged that the figure had been cooked up. \"They have no data on HIV-infected children. Even their website is silent on the number of paediatric HIV+ patients even though it declares the number of infected men, women and youth in the state. We had filed an RTI in August seeking information on the district-wise distribution of HIV positive children. After staying mum for months, they sent us a break-up of the number of patients across the districts on December 3. It said 684 was the total number. Kolkata, if they are to be believed, has just 50 HIV-infected children,\" said Bappaditya Mukherjee, secretary of Prantakatha. The WBSAPCS, however, claimed the data was authentic. \"We have collected the figures after a thorough interaction with local networks and scanning their information base. A large percentage of the HIV-infected children in Kolkata actually hail from the districts and they have been included in our list. But it's true that there's no government home for HIV children,\" said Swarnadipa Biswas, deputy director of WBSAPCS. Ananda Ghar, the only home for HIV+ children in the state has 42 inmates. Privately run by an NGO at Gobindopur in South 24-Parganas, it claimed that hundreds of infected youngsters from Kolkata and its outskirts were eager to join the home. \"At least, 150 children are waiting and we have regular contacts with them. Most are either orphans or social outcasts. This proves that the WBSAPCS data is fabricated. They have neither done a survey nor have any programme to care for these children,\" said Kallol Ghosh of OFFER, the NGO which runs the home. What could be even more dangerous is the threat they pose in terms of transmission, many pointed out. \"Few of the kids are aware of their status and have no access to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). Since a high percentage of them are drug-users, they could well be transmitting the disease,\" said Tarit Chakraborty, secretary of BNP Plus a network of HIV-positive people. Less than 25% of the children now receive ART, said an official at the ART centre in Calcutta Medical College Hospital. \"There has never been any study or survey. But information from private bodies working across the state, shows the total number of infected children could be more than 3000,\" said the official."

TimesViewThis is a real sunshine story. Congratulations are in order for the property owners who have risen above such evidently widespread \u2014 but completely unfounded \u2014 prejudice. We hope the rest of the city learns from this; these kids deserve all our support in their struggle. At 524 Jodhpur Park, a senior official of a leading national ayurvedic firm and an honorary member of Rotary Club of Calcutta has offered his garage space to the teenagers from where they plan to start the caf\u00e9 in July. \u201cI was initially a bit hesitant to offer my garage space as it is much smaller than what they were looking for. But after learning that they had failed to manage any space in over six months, I told them to start their business from here. This can be the beginning from where they can spread their wings.

The caf\u00e9 is scheduled to start from July 14, coinciding with Rath Yatra. \u201cWe will begin with an assortment of hot and cold coffees, mocktails and mojitos, and at least four types of cakes, veg and non-veg sandwiches and cookies. For now, we will bank more on takeaway service till we get a bigger place with a larger seating capacity,\u201d said Susanta Pal (name changed), one of the 10 youths. \u201cIt has been a long wait. At one time, we thought we would never get space for our shop after being rejected by several house-owners. But now that we have finally managed one, I am happy and looking forward to a better future. We will be able to wipe off the taboos associated with the disease we suffer from with day-to-day interaction with our customers,\u201d said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another member."

Earlier this year, the private firm forced him to resign with a monetary compensation. Adding to his woes, a legislation that promises to punish such discrimination has been in the works for several years now. The HIV/AIDS Bill was drafted in 2006, but is being shunted between the health and law ministries. Activists, lawyers and people living with HIV have been fighting for the Bill to be introduced during the winter session of Parliament. Rallies are planned across the country to highlight the issue on Sunday, World AIDS Day. A senior National AIDS Control Organisation official told TOI that the Bill was now with the Cabinet. The Bill will provide protection against discrimination in employment, education, healthcare, travel, and insurance. \u201cIt brings the private sector within its ambit. We want the Bill to be introduced in Parliament during the winter session so that it does not lapse after the general elections,\u201d said Surekha Shetty, Legal and Advocacy Officer, Lawyers Collective.

Yet, in the last tourist season Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) targeted 600 men having sex with men (MSM) and just 200 female sex workers (FSW). According to GACS officials, Goa's profile as a hot-spot international tourist destination has been attracting a number of male and female sex workers who expressly come to Goa during the tourist season and even take on stray jobs during the day. While the exact number of sex workers visiting Goa during the season is not available, GSACS figures of 600 MSM as against 200 FSW raises eyebrows. GSACS officials claim they are not able to tap more FSWs because of the difficulties involved in identifying them. \"Their profiles are varied. Some operate as high-end calls girls, some work in beauty parlours and spas and it is not simple to uncover their real identity to reach out to them,\" a GSACS official said. Identifying MSM is relatively easy, says the GSACS official, as they can be recognized from their style of dressing and walking. Nonetheless, going after them is a tough job, he claimed. GSACS officials prefer to keep their activities on a low key so as to not expose their peer educators to harassment by police. He said the society's peer educators are able to reach out to lower strata of FSW who come to Goa during the season time. \"The peer educators have to work beyond regular working hours, especially at night, battling police who don't take a sympathetic view of their work. The peer educators provide contraceptives and literature in the form of booklets to create awareness among sex workers about safe sex and HIV/AIDS,\" he claimed.

The scientists said they were unable to take the study further because mass production of the vaccine isn\u2019t possible. Across the world, most AIDS vaccine candidates have been unable to create adequate immunity in the body to fight HIV effectively, though they can be mass-produced. The first significant Indian effort floundered at because not enough quantities of the vaccine candidate could be produced for further trials. Scientists say this is a setback to Indian efforts to develop an indigenous AIDS vaccine. Researchers will now have to look for fresh candidates. \u201cWe are back to where it all began,\u201d said Dr Rajat Goyal, country head, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. The National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai and National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) spearheaded the phase 1 trial of the MVA (Modified Vaccinia Anacara)-based vaccine candidate (TBC-M4).The effort was part of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. The vector-based vaccine was designed by Kolkata scientist Shekar Chakraborty. In 2007, the results showed that the vaccine was safe and tolerated by the body without side effects. But scientists felt they could increase the strength of the vaccine by giving a booster. This trial began in 2009 and on September 14, scientists told an international AIDS conference in Bangkok that the vaccine strength did not double as expected. \u201cIt is possible to scale up research. But we will not be able to do that because we are not able to mass produce this vaccine,\u201d said Dr V D Ramanathan,who led the research from the Tuberculosis Centre. In the MVA vaccine, six modified genes of the HIV are inserted inside a shell of weakened small pox vaccine. So far, the vaccine has been administered to 64 healthy individuals in two phases. For further studies, the scientists required at least 1,000 doses of the vaccine. Normally, in vaccine production, a source is created and multiplied. \u201cThe vaccine began to lose its strength as we tried to scale up production and increase the volume,\u201d said Dr Goyal. But scientists hope that they might be successful in scaling up production in future."

Laxmi, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, had got married to man working in Mumbai. After marriage, she became pregnant. She came back to her native place to deliver the baby but medical tests revealed that she had acquired HIV. She gave birth to the child who, mercifully, was free of the virus. When she returned to her husband in Mumbai and told him that she had HIV, he threw her out and disowned her. With nowhere to go, she begged at Mumbai Railway station for a few days with her newborn baby. After two days, however, she returned to her parents. To her dismay, even her parents refused to let her into their house. Feeling helpless, Laxmi decided to come to Ahmedabad where her aunt (mausi) lived in Bapu Nagar locality. Her aunt accepted the baby but refused to let Laxmi live with her family. Telling herself that her child would at least have a home, the hapless mother gave the child to her aunt and left. Unable to live with the stigma of HIV and the social boycott that came with the disease, Laxmi decided to end her life. She went to Kalupur Railway station with the thought of jumping in front of a train. But at the railway station she came across the signboard of the NGO, Adhar, which helps HIV positive people cope with the disease. The NGO also runs a marriage bureau for HIV positive people. It helped Laxmi get married for a second time. The UP woman is now married and lives a normal life in Ahmedabad. Laxmi and her husband have decided not to have children. Meanwhile, Laxmi's first husband has died of Aids. (Name has been changed to protect the identity)"

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization (WHO) has approved a first-of-its-kind, non-surgical circumcision device to forestall the spread of AIDS. The device called PrePex is the only adult circumcision method, aside from conventional surgery, to gain WHO approval to date. The nonsurgical circumcision device relies on a rubber band and was approved by the WHO recently, opening the way for its widespread use in Africa, The New York Times reported. Dr Eric P Goosby, the US Global AIDS Coordinator, said that it would \"truly help save lives\" and that he was prepared to use funds from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief for it. For a heterosexual man in countries where Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is common, being circumcised lowers the chance of contracting HIV or getting infected by the virus by about 60 per cent, according to the report. The US has paid for more than two million circumcisions in Africa in the past few years. The WHO's goal is 20 million by 2015. PrePex can be quickly put in place by a two-nurse team. The foreskin dies from the pressure of the rubber band in a grooved ring, and drops off or is clipped off a week later, the report said. The procedure uses only topical anaesthesia and is safer than surgery."

The woman\u2019s family members blamed the Red Cross blood bank for supplying the infected blood. Her enraged relatives ransacked the Red Cross society on Monday and the cops had to intervene to pacify the angry protesters. The 20-year-old woman (name withheld) from Venkateswara colony in Nellore had married a daily wage earner about a year ago. Upon getting pregnant, she was consulting doctors of a private hospital and got admitted to the hospital on November 2. The doctors asked her husband to get three units of blood from the Red Cross society as she was anemic. She was going to be subjected to caesarean section operation and would have needed blood transfusion. Her husband bought three units of blood from Red Cross society, which the doctors used for the operation. She was discharged from hospital a week later with mild fever. However, the woman did not get relief from fever even 15 days after being discharged. Her family members again took her to the hospital where she was subjected to tests. To their utter shock, the blood test report said she had tested positive for HIV. With all the blood tests done before the delivery clearly indicating that she was HIV negative, the doctors suspected that the blood infused during the delivery could have been infected. The family members rushed to the Red Cross society from where they had got the blood but to their surprise, the officials denied that they had sold any blood to them. \u201cThey should be arrested and sent to jail for their negligence,\u201d said Nissar Ahmed, the woman\u2019s husband.

        "body": "PUNE: The Bombay high court on Wednesday ordered the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) to reinstate an HIVpositive driver it had removed from service in 2012 after a medical report declared him unfit to drive heavy vehicles. Adivision bench of the HC comprising Justice Abhay Oak and Justice Revati Mohite-Dere directed the MSRTC to reinstate the driver within a week and said the issue of compensating him will be decided on September 13 when the matter will be next heard. The MSRTC had removed the driver from service on May 16, 2012. The corporation based its decision on the report of the medical superintendent of the Sassoon general hospital here, submitted a day earlier, which stated that the driver was suffering from \u201cimmuno compromise status with peripheral neuropathy without motor deficit\u201d . The report had said he was unfit to work as a driver for heavy vehicles. The driver filed a writ petition on July 25 the same year against the MSRTC and others challenging his suspension. He said the Sassoon medical superintendent had, on February 8, 2012, issued a letter stating that while he was unfit to drive heavy vehicles, he was suitable for light work. Earlier, on September 4, 2009, the medical superintendent had issued a letter that he was fit to work as a driver, the petition stated. In his petition, the driver alleged that he had been removed from service because he was suffering from HIV. He said his salary has been pending with the MSRTC since December 8, 2011. The driver had been diagnosed with HIV in 2008 and has been on anti-retroviral therapy at the Sassoon hospital ever since. The petition also states that there were times when the driver could not report to work because of depression due to the diagnosis and that he has to deal with the misconceptions that society has about the disease. The driver was provided free legal assistance by Sahyog Trust run by lawyer Asim Sarode and his wife. Speaking to TOI, Sarode said, \u201cRemoving a person from work because of his/her HIV/AIDS condition is a violation of the right to livelihood and a human rights violation.\u201d Sarode described the HC order as a landmark judgment for persons suffering from such medical conditions in the state. \u201cIn the absence of any law to protect such persons from constant discrimination, stigma and exploitation, the HC order is truly constructive and will create a long-lasting impact in creating a rights-based approach of looking at such cases,\u201d he said. Sarode was assisted by lawyers Kiran Kulkarni and Manish Dikshit."

In Prem Ganj, one of the three villages where 38 had been found HIV positive, majority of houses don\u2019t have toilet. Those with the infection are now being stopped from defecating in the fields by influential local people. Gangadeen, 54, who has been found HIV positive and lives on the outer part of Prem Ganj along with his four children, only wishes to have atoilet in his house which would not only prevent him from relieving in the open, but avoid wrath of \u2018powerful\u2019 locals. \u201cWe can\u2019t use farmlands because they fear that they too will contract the virus,\u201d said Gangadeen. \u201cRich and mighty have built toilets in their homes but the poor people like us cannot afford it,\u201d said Bhanu, 45, another HIV positive from Prem Ganj. 49 with HIV getting treatment in Kanpur Days after 58 people from Bangarmau in Unnao district were found HIV positive, 49 of them contacted doctors at the anti-retro viral therapy (ART) centre in Kanpur for treatment. They were reportedly infected by a quack, Rajendra Yadav, who allegedly used the same syringe to inject all patients, thus spreading the virus. There are no toilets in our houses and we have to use either the area near the farms to relieve ourselves or railway tracks. Powerful and mighty people stop us from defecating in their fields, while RPF (Railway Protection Force) book us for tresspassing. It seems toilets are meant only for \u2018rich\u2019 and not for poor people like us,\u201d says Parmanand, 60, another HIV positive. When contacted, an influential farmer said they cannot allow HIV positive people to use their farmlands for defecation. \u201cThey have already ruined their lives. If we will allow them, they will spread HIV virus and ruin us and our future generations,\u201d he said. Govind, another HIV positive, said, \u201cOnly a couple of days ago I was threatened of dire consequences but I could not muster courage and file a complaint against him because none in my village was ready to support me.\u201d Local corporator Sunil Kumar, meanwhile, said he had received complaints in this regard and he will request the district administration to build toilets particularly for the HIV affected patients in Prem Ganj. *All names have been changed to protect identities."

Till last year, 1,325 people had died of HIV in the state but in the past 12 months there have been over 1,200 deaths taking the toll up to 2,505 till October this year. This translates into nearly 100 deaths every month across the state. In Amritsar alone, 286 people, who were on treatment for HIV succumbed to the disease while neighboring Tarn Taran reported second highest deaths, 278, during the year. It is estimated that the death rate has increased owing to phenomenal growth in the number of drug abusers sharing needles."

The PhD thesis of a professor at H K College in Ahmedabad, titled, 'Social problems faced by HIV positive people and their solutions', reveals that most patients are disowned by their families and, due to social boycott, find it difficult to get work and earn a living. Alpesh Prajapati, who did his PhD from Gujarat Vidyapith, surveyed a sample of 110 patients for his research. Most of them had been disowned by their respective families, neighbours and friends. The research also reveals that the hostility of society towards such patients has led to the creation of 'silent groups' of patients. These people have been diagnosed as being HIV positive but they do not reveal it and live with the disease as normal men and women. People with HIV find it difficult to make a living if it is known that they are infected. Thus patients find themselves fighting on many fronts at the same time. The worst impact is on the women who are found to have the Aids virus. Alpesh spent four years on research and suggested that a lot has to be done to spread awareness among people to remove the stigma attached to HIV. He has suggested that awareness programmes should be held at schools and in colleges."

        "body": "LUCKNOW: After running from the pillar to post for an year with no positive response from any of the government and non-government organisations (NGOs), 19-year-old Poonam (name changed) as a last resort has written an open letter to the chief minister Mayawati for help. The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year. Although she got the infection from her husband but the latter refuses to keep her saying that he has no money to bear the cost of treatment. He has also kept the baby with him. \u201cI knocked at every door possible, be it NGOs or government organisations but only got sympathies,\u201d said Poonam while narrating how her husband snatched her four-month-old daughter from her and threw her out of the house. \u201cWith no money and means of livelihood, I first went to my parents but my father was also not ready to accept me. My mother, however, intervened and helped me in approaching various government agencies and NGOs for help. However, at all the places people only made promises but none helped,\u201d she rued. Poonam only want a job so that she can be financially independent and can claim custody of her daughter. In her letter, Poonam has described how hundreds of HIV+ women like her who want to stand on their feet and fight stigma but are being pushed back by government agencies and NGOs who thrive on grants procured in the name of HIV/AIDS awareness and welfare. \u201cI hope being a women chief minister will help me out,\u201d said Poonam who signed the letter \u201cone of your daughter\u201d. A dejected Poonam has also said that she would be forced to commit suicide, if no help came from the chief minister. \u201c What option do I have...should I take to prostitution and infect others...or beg on streets... better to end life,\u201d she said. Poonam was just 16 when she was married to one Rajesh, who works as salesman in a small firm. The marriage does not have a legal sanctity because she was minor at that time. She has studied till class XI, which is also not enough to get a job. \u201c I understand the limitations but I am only asking for a job, may be a peon or a counsellor at any AIDS awareness centre or any task which may earn enough to take care of myself,\u201d she said. At present, she survives on little money her mother sends every month. During the day, she wanders on the streets looking for work and in the night finds shelter in railways and bus stations. The woman also knocked the door of the State Women Commission and State Aids Control Society as well as other NGOs working for HIV positive people but got only assurances. The episode has also exposed the poor state of affairs in government set up for providing relief and rehabilitation to abandoned HIV+ women and children. There are over 1000 NGOs, funded by the government and other national international organisations, working in the field of HIV/AIDS in UP but none have any shelter home, barring \u2018Shanti Niketan\u2019 run by the \u2018Sisters of Saint Joseph\u2019, a Christian missionary organisation, but it has limited capacity. The state has over 1.4 lakh HIV+ people, of which nearly 30% are widows who acquired infection from their husbands but after their death were disowned by in-laws. Many like Poonam are denied shelter by their parents as well. Some also have children. The only option for them is to lead a traumatised life and die in oblivion. Officers claim that government gives enough funds to the NGOs for the job. The Lucknow Network for People living with HIV and AIDS has been helping such widows but resources are limited. Members complain that NGOs take grants in the name of HIV/AIDS but have done more harm to victims than infection."

        "body": "PUNE: In the cramped, often unhygienic conditions of the 29 central and district jails in the state where medical care is down to the basics, 467 inmates have tested positive for HIV infection in the last two years. Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state. \"A total 21,404 prisoners in Maharashtra's prisons were screened in the last two years. Of them, 4,472 inmates were from Yerawada Central Jail. Among them, 120 were detected with HIV infection which is the highest in the state,\" said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) told TOI on Monday Of the 467 HIV infected prisoners, 87 have been put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 250, said Deshmukh. CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. HIV attacks these cells and uses them to spread the virus which weakens the immune system. People without HIV infection have about 700 to 1000 CD4 cells in a drop of blood. HIV infected people are considered to have normal CD4 counts if the number is above 500 CD4 cells in on blood drop. Health experts say that prisoners can be HIV infected if they participate in unprotected sex or share infected needles while using illicit drugs. They also maintained that the HIV infection rate among prisoners was lower than the general populace that came for testing to integrated counselling and treatment centres at hospitals. \"The prevalence rate comes to 2.18 per cent of the total number of prisoners which is below the 4.7 per cent incidence rate in the general population coming to ICTCs for testing,\" said Deshmukh. \"The presence of HIV infected persons and those at high risk in prisons is a critical challenge. Unlike the general population, many prisoners may not be aware if they are infected with HIV. Often, vastly crowded living conditions lead to such behaviour among prisoners,\" said A L Kakrani, professor and head department of medicine D Y Patil Medical College. He is also an ex-member of the technical resource group of the Government of India on ART. \"The tedious prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to the high-risk activities such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men,\" Kakrani said. The history of five HIV infected inmates at Yerawada jail has revealed that they were MSM (men having sex with men), said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre at the jail. \"We are spreading awareness about the risks associated with MSM among the prisoners,\" he said. A recent UNAIDS report says that the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers (FSW) and their clients, and MSMs. About 90 per cent of those newly infected with HIV in India were believed to have acquired it during unprotected sex. The ICTC facilities The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) facilities were started at Yerawada and Amravati jails by the MSACS as a pilot project on October 2, 2008 . The move came following a directive by the Bombay High Court. The ICTC facilities with full-time counsellors and technicians have been started at five more jails including Nashik, Taloja, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur. The other jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals that have ICTC facilities. \"There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTCs in all the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO), but they are ready to extend only training if the state government recruits workforce,\" said Deshmukh. An integrated counselling and testing centre is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The main functions of an ICTC include counselling and testing for HIV, creating awareness on modes of transmission, prevention of HIV/AIDS for promoting behavioural change and reducing vulnerability."

But after the test last week, they have started touching me again,\" said Hadibandhu Sahoo, who has been undergoing treatment for a broken spine. Sahoo had tested HIV positive in April 2011 at Swami Vivekanad National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research, an institute of the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment in Cuttack district. Sahoo, who hails from Ghantapada village in Angul district, used to work as a security guard in a biscuit manufacturing company in Bhuj, Gujarat. He had broken his spine during the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and underwent a series of treatment at various health centres. His spine, however, refused to heal and he was finally admitted to the Vivekanad National Institute for treatment from April to June 2011, where he was diagnosed HIV positive. TOI had highlighted his plight in an article published on July 6, 2011. \"I was discharged from the hospital in August and started a paan shop in Talcher with the help of the local MLA. However, people who knew my HIV status would avoid the shop,\" he said. The 50-year-old wheelchair-bound man had to be admitted to Capital Hospital when he injured his back again recently after he slipped and fell while taking a bath. In a fresh test conducted at the Integrated Counelling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Capital Hospital, Sahoo was found to be HIV negative last week. \"The recent fall was a blessing in disguise for me. I have got a new lease of life after the fresh diagnosis. I had started cursing my life earlier,\" said Sahoo, adding, \"Last time when I was hospitalized, nobody would come near me because of my HIV positive status. Now finally I am being treated as a normal person.\" When contacted, the hospitals defended the test reports. \"We rely on the rapid test kits supplied by National AIDS Control Organisation, which has a margin of error,\" said R N Mohanty, director in-charge of Vivekanad National Institute. Capital Hospital authorities said the ICTC test is a confirmatory test. \"I can't comment about test done elsewhere but ICTC tests are regarded confirmatory. We will, however, look into the matter if something may have gone wrong,\" said Capital Hospital spokesperson Dr S N Swain. HIV/AIDS activists have cautioned people not to get frustrated with rapid test kits, which may give false results."

These are among the 12,058 new patients added to the HIV/AIDS caseload over the past 12 months. Drugs like heroin, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) - known as street-drugs are commonly injected despite the high risk of contracting AIDS. In fact, one in 23 women and one in 36 men, who inject drugs have a risk of contracting AIDS, health authorities say. Overall, the state has an estimated 400 such AIDS patients who contacted the dreaded virus through intravenous drug injections. Apart from the street drugs, even prescription drugs like tablets, capsules and liquids are injected occasionally, say insiders. \"Drug abusers often begin with taking pills or snorting drugs in the powdered form, slowly graduate to the intravenous method. Most of the abusers are obsessed with being on a perpetual high. Over time, the usage of pills, capsules, puffing and snorting slowly reduce the impact and hence they switch to intravenous drugs,\" said an official at the Narcotics Control Bureau. These injectable drugs are often make from powder or crystal form of drugs by dissolving them in water. Sometimes it is even heated up if required and later drawn in to the syringe by dipping a cotton ball into the solution. \"The fact that many of the drug users also have unsafe sexual practices, increase the risk of HIV due to sharing of the syringes,\" added the official. Apart from getting a high, there are many more reasons why addicts graduate to intravenous drugs say experts, even if it comes with the highest risk of contracting AIDS as well as other blood-related infections. \"The type of injected drug are opioids- the most well-known of which is heroin. Other opioid medicines that IV drugs users frequently abuse are fentanyl, Talwin and buprenorphine, as well as the prescription painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone (the latter two are first crushed into a powder and then dissolved into a solution for injection),\" added Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant internal medicine, Maxcure hospitals. Stimulants are popular with IV drug users because they quickly deliver a strong feeling of euphoria, as well as increased energy, reduced appetite and a reduced need for sleep. \"People who repeatedly snort suffer discomfort due to perforation of nasal mucosa, sinusitis, nose bleeds, loss of sense of smell, problems in swallowing and hoarseness,\" he added."

Many sex workers were on the list for more than 15 years, others were as old as 59. A shocked Tansacs terminated the services of 10 NGOs. \u201cWe thought it was the right thing to do. Our evaluation process has no space for prejudice,\u201d said Tansacs project director Kumar Jayant. In March 2012, when funding agencies such as UNAIDS and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wound up operations and handed over projects to Tansacs, the society ordered an evaluation of all projects. In Salem and Namakkal districts, at least 23 dead people had not been taken off the HIV/AIDS risk group registers. \u201cSome women were alive but too old for sex work. Yet, they weren\u2019t removed from the register. When we asked the NGOs to strike off such names, they opposed it,\u201d said a senior official in charge of the evaluation process. The NGOs said they did not want to delete names as it would reduce funding. Funds are allotted to NGOs depending on the number of people they serve. Tansacs allots Rs 14 lakh to Rs 15 lakh for 1,500 people on the register. NGO representative A Bakthavatchalam said the review was too stringent. \u201cThe officials were prejudiced and insensitive while dealing with sex workers. When we are dealing with commercial sex workers, we won\u2019t have details about their place of stay,\u201d he said. The NGOs went on a strike and threatened to derail the AIDS prevention programmes. Last week, Tansacs\u2019 executive body reversed the termination orders and gave the NGOs till June to correct the errors. Lakshmi Bai, who was heading one of the programmes, said Tansacs did not monitor the NGOs for a long time. \u201cIf they were monitoring carefully, they would not have been surprised now,\u201d she said."

The government has made it clear very clear to them that the HIV+ girls will study in this school only,\" he added. The Gujarat State Network of Positive People (GSNP+), which takes care of the HIV+ girls, has also stopped sending the girls to the school. \"We had sent the girls on Monday and Tuesday last to the school but they were not allowed to enter the premises by the protesting parents,\" a GSNP+ office-bearer said.

The patients arrange for the blood and the hospital merely does the transfusion. Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anaemia. Hence, thalassemics need regular blood transfusions to stay alive. There about more than 4,500 thalassemic children in the state. \u201cFor the last one year, we have been conducting various medical tests on children who visit our centre for blood transfusion and 20 of them have turned out to be HIV positive,\u2019\u2019 said paediatrician Nilesh Baraiya.

The drugs are administrated to patients with low CD-4 count in their body system. Many old and new HIV positive patients are waiting to know their CD-4 count so that they can take the ART accordingly. Regular monitoring of the CD-4 count is important for the medicine to be effective. The CD-4 should be counted every six months, the doctors said. At present, 1,945 patients are being treated at the ART, Berhampur centre. Most of these patients are from Ganjam district that has the highest number of persons living with the HIV (PLWHIVs) in the state. As many as 9,768 persons had tested positive for HIV in the district by July-end. The number of HIV positive persons in the state in the same period was 25,788, sources added. Health activists said PLWHIVs coming to ART for their CD-4 test are facing many difficulties. \"Most patients are poor and they are not keen to come for the CD-4 test again going by the expenses involved,\" said Loknath Mishra, director, ARUNA, an NGO working for HIV positive patients in Ganjam district. A doctor in the ART centre said they administrated the drugs to patients by observing some other conditions. Similarly, the pre-ART treatment was provided, at least for a fortnight, to the new HIV patients. \"Treatment has not been completely stopped due to the defunct CD-4 machine,\" the ART doctor said. Medical college authorities said they were trying to repair the machine as quickly as possible. \"We have invited engineers from outside the state,\" said principal Sonamali Bag.

        "title": "Rate of new HIV infections fell by over 50% in India: UNAIDS",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: The rate of new HIV infections fell by more than 50 per cent in India between 2001 and 2009, double of the average decline in the world, according to a new report released on Friday by UNAIDS which said the global response to AIDS is showing results. \"In India, the rate of new HIV infections fell by more than 50 per cent and in South Africa by more than 35 per cent; both countries have the largest number of people living with HIV on their continents,\" according to 'AIDS at 30: Nations at the Crossroads' study. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) report said the global rate of new HIV infections declined by nearly 25 per cent between 2001 and 2009. As the world marks 30 years of AIDS, UNAIDS estimates about 34 million people are living with HIV and nearly 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes since the first case of AIDS was reported on June 5, 1981. It said about 6.6 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in low and middle-income countries at the end of 2010, a nearly 22-fold increase since 2001. A record 1.4 million people started life-saving treatment in 2010 -- more than any year before. According to the report, at least 4,20,000 children were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2010, a more than 50 per cent increase since 2008. \"Access to treatment will transform the AIDS response in the next decade. We must invest in accelerating access and finding new treatment options,\" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. The report found that in the third decade of the epidemic, people were starting to adopt safer sexual behaviours, reflecting the impact of HIV prevention and awareness efforts. However, there are still important gaps. Young men are more likely to be informed about HIV prevention than young women. Recent demographic health surveys found that an estimated 74 per cent of young men know that condoms are effective in preventing HIV infection, compared to just 49 per cent of young women. In recent years, there has been significant progress in preventing new HIV infections among children as increasing numbers of pregnant women living with HIV have gained access to antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The number of children newly infected with HIV in 2009 was 26 per cent lower than in 2001. About 115 low and middle-income countries are providing optimal treatment regimens for pregnant women living with HIV as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The report, however, said despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, a major treatment gap remains. At the end of 2010, nine million people who were eligible for treatment did not have access. Treatment access for children is lower than for adults. While the rate of new HIV infections has declined globally, the total number of HIV infections remains high, at about 7000 per day. The global reduction in the rate of new HIV infections hides regional variations. According to the report, above-average declines in new HIV infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and in South-East Asia, while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more modest reductions of less than 25 per cent. There has been an increase in rate of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the report, gender inequalities remain a major barrier to effective HIV responses. HIV is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, and more than a quarter (26 per cent) of all new global HIV infections are among young women aged 15-24."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: US researchers have patented a low-cost printer that helps HIV patients living in low-resource settings track the health of their cells. Patients with HIV are encouraged to participate in regular checkups to keep track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow cytometers complete the tests by analysing the blood. Flow cytometers, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. The machines also cost upwards of USD 50,000. \"Flow cytometers are not practical for areas with limited resources like Africa or Mexico,\" said Thomas Boland, a professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas at El Paso who created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells - cells that are attacked by HIV - in the body. After drawing a patient's blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that's been modified to print out cells instead of ink. Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide. CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it. That number is inserted into an equation that calculates the total number of CD4 cells in the individual's body. The procedure takes as little as 20 minutes, resulting in ultra-quick results. Boland hopes his new printer will help doctors and patients in low-resource settings who don't have access to flow cytometers. The next step in the process is to license the technology to a company that is willing to help get it on the market. Several doctors in Mexico have already expressed interest in the device, Boland said."

We have sanctioned financial aid of Rs 600-Rs 800 to around 550 people from the scheme for the destitute,\u201d Jarad said on Friday. During his routine camps in rural Thane, Jarad found that most of the HIV-positive people were facing a financial crisis and owing to the stigma, they were unable to take up physical work. Subsequently, in collaboration with the public health department, Jarad personally conducted a survey of the district. However, HIV-positive people were reluctant to come forward to accept financial assistance. As a special measure, teams were sent to the homes of 550 persons to complete the formalities for the scheme. \u201cWe sent out teams to 15 tehsils and identified the beneficiaries, provided them proof of residence, income certificate and civil surgeon\u2019s certificate. Later, we submitted the papers to a high-level committee, which quickly approved the financial assistance,\u201d Jarad said. In Thane district alone, there are 12,000 persons undergoing treatment for HIV, but not all, are eligible. At the state level, a senior public health department official said, there were 4.2 lakh HIV-positive cases. \u201cOf these, over one lakh are below the poverty line. The government should extend the Thane exercise to the entire state,\u201d he said. Of the 4.2 lakh HIV+ve cases in Maharashtra, over a lakh are below the poverty line.

        "body": "Ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic may be possible by implementing a multifaceted global effort that expands testing, treatment, and prevention programs, as well as meets the scientific challenges of developing an HIV vaccine and possibly a cure, say researchers. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International AIDS Conference. Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV. \u201cSince the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d Dr. Fauci and Gregory K. Folkers, M.S., M.P.H., also of the NIAID, wrote. \u201cImportant challenges remain\u2014notably finding the resources and developing the infrastructure to provide antiretroviral therapy to the estimated 8 million individuals with HIV infection who need these drugs but are not receiving them,\u201d they noted. The researchers added that antiretroviral therapy could also prevent HIV infection by reducing the amount of virus in an infected person''s blood and other body fluids, making it less likely that the virus will be transmitted to others. Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission. Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection. \u201cEach of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,\u201d they said. They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible. The prospect of an HIV cure remains challenging. The researchers concluded that ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic \u201cwill require a global commitment of resources involving additional donor countries, strengthening health care systems overall, and fostering greater ownership by host countries of HIV/AIDS effort, including investing more in the health of their people. With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.\u201d Their recommendation appeared in the latest issue of JAMA, a theme issue on HIV/AIDS."

        "body": "TRICHY: The number of HIV positive babies born to AIDS-infected mothers has come down drastically thanks to the new type of treatment at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. In 2013, 38 babies born to HIV positive mothers tested negative in Trichy. Since the beginning of this year, 'Nevirapine' tablets were administered to HIV-positive mothers 76 hours before delivery while babies were administered Nevirapine syrup from the time of their birth at all ART centres. Though that type of treatment was useful to bring down the number of births of HIV-positive babies, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) that decided to eradicate it completely, made a change in the treatment method. As per the new method, the Nevirapine tablets should be taken by HIV-positive mothers for 14 weeks during pregnancy and the babies should be given Nevirapine syrup for at least six months. Dr Manivannan, medical officer of the ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Trichy said that the new regimen of treatment was proved to be effective to ensure the birth of HIV-negative babies born to HIV-positive mothers. \"We work towards achieving the target of nil birth of HIV-positive babies in 2015. We hope it will be possible to reach the target with the present mode of treatment to the HIV-positive mothers. With this method, we can bring down the rate of possibility of babies getting affected to one to two percent from the previous rate of 20 per cent,\" he said. In 2012, 45 babies were born to HIV-positive mothers. However, only one baby tested positive and the rest of them tested negative. It is unfortunate that in most of the cases the HIV-positive mothers are victims of marriage with HIV-positive men. At the time of marriage, women are not made aware whether their partners are HIV-positive. On the other hand, the men are also lethargic to go for HIV test before marriage. \"When it is found during pregnancy check-up that a woman is HIV-positive, it comes as a shock to them. But many of the uneducated people from rural areas are not bothered about it. At the same time, the educated people from urban areas completely collapse. So, we have to provide counselling to them to give morale booster,\" said Dr Manivannan who appealed to all the married women to undergo HIV test. The blood of the new born baby is tested through dry blood sample (DBC) method at the Tuberculosis Centre in Chennai. Normally, the presence of HIV virus can be confirmed only after 18 months of delivery. However, Dr Manivannan said that the results through DBC method would almost be the same as the results that come after 18 months."

The HIV-2 strain, is common in west African countries like Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and is rarely found outside the African continent. The HIV-2 virus, is considered more vicious compared to the HIV-1 virus. In the last six months alone, about 67 samples sent to Institute of Preventive Medicines (IPM) by the APSACS (Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society) have tested positive. Furthermore, dozens of samples are currently awaiting confirmation for the presence of the virus. The IPM uses the more accurate western blot method for detection of the virus. Even private hospitals are getting cases of patients affected with the virus. \"It is a fact that few even in the medical profession are not adequately informed about the HIV-2 virus,\" said Sunita Narreddy from the infection diseases specialty of Apollo Hospitals where about five cases of HIV-2 were recorded this year. \"Though HIV-1 and HIV-2 belong to the same family, the two differ in terms of their testing methodologies and treatment. Testing is comparatively easier for the HIV-1 virus unlike the HIV-2 virus. Also, there are better treatment options for HIV-1 virus compared to the latter,\" said Narreddy. Although the method of transmission for both the viruses is same, medicines to treat HIV-1 patients do not work for HIV-2 patients. This explains the fact that there are currently no medicines that the government is prescribing for HIV-2 patients. \"Medicines for treating HIV-2 virus are still in the testing stages, There are no approved drugs that work for this virus anywhere in the world. Hence, we cannot risk a patient's life by administering any drugs at this point of time,\" said a government official of the state health department. In India, there have been a few cases of HIV-2 being reported from some pockets in and around Mumbai. \"We cannot explain how this virus spread to this state. But, the numbers are higher in certain areas of Guntur district.\" said a member of an organization working on the HIV programmes. There have also been some cases of the same person carrying both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus. According to the state records, about 5 lakh people have been identified as HIV positive in the state."

Bone marrow transplant on a patient infected with HIV is ridden with risks and the procedure was a huge challenge for the 100-odd team of doctors and para-medical staff at the Majumdar Shaw Cancer Centre. This is, according to the doctor who treated Sachin, is the second successful case in the world and the first in India. The boy hasn\u2019t shown symptoms of HIV for the past five months. \u201cWe were devastated to know he was contracted with the deadly virus. We approached many transplant centres, but none of them wanted to even touch him,\u201d said Sachin\u2019s father who finally decided to try his luck in Bengaluru. \u201cWhen he came, the boy\u2019s immune system was weak and infections were high. I realized that HIV infection could flare up during the transplant. That was the biggest challenge for us. The whole process, including preparing the boy for the surgery, took several weeks. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched with his sibling, making the transplant possible,\u201d Dr Sunil Bhat, senior consultant and head of paediatric haematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Centre, Narayana Health City. Sachin\u2019s HIV infection is now under control and he no longer needs any blood transfusion, he added. It may be too early to predict, given that the transplant took place just five months ago. But if the boy doesn\u2019t show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV. There\u2019s no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process. Sachin\u2019s six-year-old brother, the bone marrow donor in this case, is completely healthy Dr Sunil Bhat, head of paediatric haematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Centre, Narayana Health City"

If all goes well, another such marriage, this time inter-caste, will take place in the state soon. In the May 13 marriage at Radhakrishna temple in Unit VIII, the bride was a widow from Ranapur block in Nayagarh district who had lost her husband to the killer disease around a year after her marriage in 2006. The groom was another HIV+ youth of Chandaka village on the city outskirts who had left home after he discovered his HIV+ status. \"This is my second marriage and a new beginning of life,\" said the woman who did not want to be named. \"I was pregnant when my first husband died. My child died a few months after birth. I was diagnosed with HIV during an illness after that and I realized the cause of my husband's and child's death. Life was hell,\" said the bride. The 30-year-old said her in-laws rejected her. \"I came in contact with the volunteers of KNP+ during treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital. They also helped me get a share of my husband's property and now found a new life partner for me,\" she said. The groom, who now runs a dhaba at his village, said, \"After finding out about my HIV status I had left home fearing stigma and rejection. But then, I liked the idea of getting married. That is why I returned home and started a dhaba to support my would be wife.\" KNP+ president Prabhasini Pradhan said the major focus of the support group was facilitating the marriage of HIV infected people and giving them a new lease of life. \"We have been functioning like a marriage bureau to facilitate bride and groom hunting among the positive people,\" she said. Pradhan said KNP+ had arranged a meeting between the family members of a Titilagarh youth with that of a widow in Puri recently. \"Both families are very keen about the marriage prospects though they are from different castes,\" Pradhan said. While the prospective groom is a businessman, the Puri woman was widowed four months after her marriage to a driver, she said.According to the Orissa State AIDS Control Society, Orissa has over 20,000 confirmed cases of HIV positive people, including around 1500 AIDS patients, as on March 31.The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has estimated that the prevalence of HIV in the state rose from 0.25 in 2000 to 0.29 per cent in 2009."

In a status report on children impacted by HIV/AIDS, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has questioned the complex eligibility criteria for the scheme launched in fiscal 2012-13. A 2012 study by Delhi State AIDS Control Society estimates the number of orphans and vulnerable children in Delhi as 1,908, of whom 766 were infected with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, there were 1,142 children whose parents were infected with the virus. The data used in the DCPCR study was gathered during the period April 2010-March 2012 from nine antiretroviral treatment centres, Children Affected by AIDS (CABA) pilot scheme and two institutions providing residential care to CABA in Delhi. The DCPCR study finds the coverage of the Financial Assistance Scheme for People Living with HIV/AIDS ((PLHA) of Delhi Government wanting in many ways. The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children. A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme. However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi. DCPCR strongly feels these need to be reviewed. \u201cOften lack of papers like death certificate or proof of residence can hinder access to these schemes. If the process is simplified, more would be able to get its benefit,\u201d DCPCR chairperson Arun Mathur said."

        "body": "NAGPUR: Last week, some of the NGOs working on projects aimed at reducing the prevalence of HIV-Aids got the necessary funds from the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). It has now been come to fore that the money had already been forwarded to all the SACS in July. MSACS authorities have also acknowledged this but said it was due to unavoidable, bureaucratic reasons that the funds were delayed. Disgruntled by the delay in getting funds, some of the project directors from the city had written about their problems to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). In response, the organization, which was an autonomous entity under the union ministry of health and family welfare until a year ago, forwarded them a letter dated July 24, 2015. This letter clearly states that a total amount of Rs274.52 crores had been released to the SACS. This would come to a sum of around Rs11 crore for each society across the country. During the troubled times over the last couple of months, as the NGOs sought different ways to protest the delay in disbursement of funds, MSACS officials had acknowledged having received the funds. When TOI had spoken with Dr MS Diggikar, joint director, care, support and treatment (CST) department of MSACS, he had said that the process of release of funds was almost complete and they may be expected in the next week. Other officials had also said that the problem was red-tape rather than lack of funds. \u201cEarlier, NACO was an independent body under the health ministry. All funds released by them would come directly to our accounts and would be distributed among the NGOs within a couple of days. Since NACO has now been merged with National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), the money is sent to the state government. The finance department of the state has to approve the funds that are meant to be used by us. Then, they have to send it for approval of the planning department and then we get them,\u201d said an official from the society. The process take a lot of time while the files move from one department to the other so the delay of a couple of months has to be expected, he added. The possibility of such administrative difficulties had worried activists and project directors even before NACO was merged with NRHM. \u201cBefore this, funds were never delayed beyond a couple of months. The merger has made things difficult for us as in a programme of such wide spectrum as NRHM, HIV-AIDS takes a lower priority,\u201d said Anand Chandrani from Sarathi Trust which is one of the affected NGOs. Most activists want the merger to be taken back."

The funding and the number of research papers coming out in international journals is largely insufficient and disappointing given the number of people suffering from the viral infection, they said. On Saturday, at the international symposium on HIV and Infectious diseases organized by the YRG Care here, experts said there was a need for youngsters to get into basic and applied research in HIV/AIDS. \"It's been 25 years since we first diagnosed HIV in this country. But the number of research papers that have come out of our country is abysmally low,\" said Dr Suniti Solomon, who diagnosed the first HIV/AIDS case in the country. Results of a global clinical trial showed that treating HIV-infected individuals with antiretrovirals - the drug of choice for people with HIV/AIDS - can reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to the uninfected partner by 96%. \"India was a part of this trial. But we should have ideally been a forerunner. In most couples, only one is HIV positive. They always ask if they can have healthy babies without the virus being transmitted to the non-infected person,\" Dr Solomon said. India has been a part of some global research like that of vaccines. So far, India has worked on at least vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS. The National AIDS Research Institute and the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis have been involved in clinical trails and some private centres have been working on gels that can prevent transmission. \"But the number of international papers coming out of India is less than most developing countries,\" said Dr VD Ramanathan of the National Institute for Tuberculosis Research, who is part of the AIDS vaccine trial. Most researchers said that international funding for HIV/AIDS has declined as the prevalence rate has also relatively dropped. \"It is important to ensure that we stay on a par with global research. That way we will also be able to find solutions for problems specific to our region,\" said Rajat Goyal of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative."

Police said Isaac Robin, 34, of Kalandhapanai in Panakudi police limits in Tiruneveli district had been working as a supervisor at construction sites. He used to travel to different states as part of his job. His mother Gnanalet and brother Prabu, 30, were living in their native village. His father, Jacon, died a few years ago. Last year, Robin came home as he fell sick and medical examination confirmed that he was suffering from AIDS. He stayed with his mother and brother. However, their relatives started distancing themselves from Robin's family. Over a period of time, visits by outsiders stopped when they came to know of Robin's disease. Disheartened by the social stigma, the mother and brother asked Robin to leave home. But he refused. On August 5, the mother lodged a complaint with the Panakudi police claiming that her son had started vomiting blood and died a few minutes later. Police registered a case under Section 174 of the IPC and the body was sent for postmortem. The body was handed over to the family on August 7 and it was cremated later. However, the postmortem report, which came on Saturday, revealed that the man had been strangled and that his neck bones and windpipe were broken. Upon the directions of Tirunelveli superintendent of police Vijayendra Bidari, police registered a case under Section 302 of the IPC and launched a lookout for Gnanalet, Prabu and his friend Vivek, 29, who were absconding. The mother and brother were arrested on Sunday and they confessed to murdering the man. Police said that Robin had come to the house against his mother's wish and started consuming liquor along with his brother and Vivek. He began to abuse his mother in an inebriated state in front of his brother, who allegedly strangled him. The superintendent of police said it looked as if social stigma had led to the mother and sibling resorting to the extreme step. They were remanded in police custody."

Taking a note of this, chief medical officer (CMO), Dr J L Mishra constituted a probe in the case. The committee however could not scan the records of government blood bank, the only blood bank in Sultanpur. \u201cThe team was busy checking details and records of the nursing homes in question,\u201d said Dr Mishra adding that the final report is expected by Wednesday. The officer agreed that there was no other source for blood units in the city. So, why is the probe team focusing on nursing homes and not the blood bank? Answering this he said, \u201cWe are trying to get details from all the ends and nursing homes are a crucial link.\u201d Meanwhile, show cause notices were issued to private nursing homes, where Durga was admitted. Citing preliminary report, he said that the nursing homes were not keeping proper records. Besides this, name of doctors mentioned on admission ticket were not present. They also found that Durga was not attended by a female doctor which is another violation of the laid down rules. \u201cProcedural irregularities at the nursing homes have made it difficult to trace the source of blood transfused to the patient.\u201d The CMO has also written to the anti retroviral therapy centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU) to find out the possibilities of getting HIV infection from contaminated blood or blood products. Head of the ART centre, Prof AK Tripathi in this regard said, \u201cTransfusing contaminated blood means 100 % chances of getting the infection. Presence of the virus can be confirmed from the lymph nodes with 4-5 hours and from the blood stream in 3-4 days.\u201d Durga was first admitted to Vandana nursing home on June 2, where doctors told her husband to arrange two units of blood. She was then given three units of blood at Allied Nursing Home on June 6. HIV infection was confirmed at Astha Nursing Home, which referred her to government women\u2019s hospital.

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Harvard researchers have used a new gene-editing technique to create what could prove to be an effective method for blocking HIV from invading and destroying patients' immune systems. This is the first published report of a group using CRISPR/Cas technology to efficiently and precisely edit clinically relevant genes out of cells collected directly from people, in this case human blood-forming stem cells and T-cells, researchers said. The work was led by Chad Cowan and Derrick Rossi, associate professors in Harvard's Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB). HIV specifically targets T cells, a principal portion of the blood-based immune system, and enters via a gene receptor called CCR5 that serves as a doorway into the cells. Once inside the T cells, HIV replicates and kills off the host cells, leaving patients at the mercy of a variety of opportunistic infections. Using the CRISPR/Cas gene-editing technology, the researchers knocked the CCR5 receptor out of blood stem cells that they showed could give rise to differentiated blood cells that did not have CCR5. In theory, such gene-edited stem cells could be introduced into HIV patients via bone marrow transplantation, the procedure used to transplant blood stem cells into leukemia patients, to give rise to HIV-resistant immune systems. \"We showed that you can knock out CCR5 very efficaciously, we showed that the cells are still functional, and we did very, very deep sequencing analysis to show that there were no unwanted mutations, so it appears to be safe,\" Cowan said. Though the researchers believe that this new approach to HIV therapy might be ready for human safety trials in less than five years, they urge caution. The work could run into unexpected complications and the history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is littered with \"cures\" that turned out not to be, researchers said. Even if this new approach works perfectly, it will require additional developments to be applicable in the areas of the world that have been the hardest hit by the epidemic, they said."

This issue was brought up by an NGO \u2013 Punjab Networking of Positive People Society \u2013 actively working against the discrimination with HIV positive people, and for the rights of the affected people, and awareness of AIDS. On behalf of the outreach workers opposing this \u2018insensitive\u2019 step of Dr Sooch, the NGO has written letters to Punjab health minister Surjit Kumar Jiyani, Punjab State Human Rights Commission, and the National AIDS Control Society. They will be submitting a memorandum to deputy commissioner of Ludhiana, Rajat Aggarwal, on Monday, demanding legal action against Dr Sooch, and an inquiry into the whole case. Meanwhile, Sooch has denied giving the statement. \u201cI have given no such statement anywhere. I know the rules, and I also know that if I do not follow them, no one else will,\u201d he emphasized. President of the NGO, Jagjit Singh Mann, while talking to ToI, said: \u201cWhen it comes to keeping the identity of the HIV positive patient confidential, there are very minute things on which people need to focus, otherwise it can lead to discrimination against them in society. Keeping in mind the guidelines, some outreach workers or their family members are supposed to be HIV positive patients. If Dr Sooch knew that the identity of the HIV positive outreach worker was being discussed openly, then he should have been taken care to conceal it. However, until now, none of the staff working with the outreach worker knew that she was HIV positive. But after this disclosure, she is under threat of discrimination at her workplace, and also where she lives.\u201d The NGO also brought to light that there is shortage of technical staff in Ludhiana at many places for the past one year, but there have been no appointments made by the district AIDS control society. Non-technical staff doing HIV tests in CMCH According to present information, both the posts of lab technicians at the ICTC of the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Ludhiana, are lying vacant for about a year, and the lives of patients getting HIV tests done have been put at stake with non-technical staff doing the tests. It is to be noted that there are nine ICTCs in Ludhiana district \u2013 five of them in the villages of Payal, Khanna, Jagraon, Raikot, and Samrala; and four of them in the city at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Civil Hospital, and two at the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). According to the guidelines of the National AIDS Control Society (NACO), there should be a counsellor, a lab technician, and an outreach worker at an ICTC, who can then refer the HIV positive patient to an ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centre in the city for treatment. NGO head Mann said: \u201cAs the lab technician is not available, other non-technical staff are asked to perform the task of technical staff. How can we depend on such lax AIDS control services in the city? The condition is the same at some other ICTCs also, where lab technicians are available.\u201d When Sooch was questioned about this, he told ToI: \u201cWe are looking for lab technicians for the two ICTCs at CMCH. Very soon, the appointments will be made.\u201d"

        "body": "Panaji: Though statistics provided by the Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) depict a gradual decline in the number of HIV and AIDS cases in Goa over the last five years, GSACS has stepped up its efforts to reduce the number HIV/AIDS cases in the state even further. Last year, 532 cases of HIV were registered in the state compared to 959 cases in 2009. A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures. GSACS project director Dr Vandana Patankar said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim. Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre. GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants. Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these women were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. \u201cPresently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,\u201d Patankar said. He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive. Presently, there is only one such centre at Calangute which is run by an NGO. GSACS is also adding one more ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Ponda. It already has 14 such centres all over Goa including three especially for expectant mothers. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sanctioned 7.55 crore for GSACS to conduct its programmes this year, but the amount is yet to be released, Patankar added."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: With an aim to make new combination drugs for HIV and Hepatitis B & C available to patients at the earliest, the government has decided to waive some of the regulatory processes to fast-track approvals. India's top drug regulator has said in a new order that companies manufacturing combination drugs for HIV and Hepatitis B & C can seek early approval with a WHO recommendation even if internationally the medicines are not approved as a combination but only individually. However, the drugs have to be relevant for India. \"Many of these combination products, recommended in WHO guidelines for concomitant use, may not have been approved internationally in combination but may have been approved individually. However, given the risk-benefit and recommendations by WHO the requirement of generated data may be waived based on the fact that the product has been recommended for concomitant use by WHO,\" the notice by G N Singh, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) said. The move is expected to benefit many of the over 21 lakh people estimated to be living with HIV in India. Moreover, viral hepatitis has also been recognised as a serious public health problem in India by the World Health Organisation (WHO) with a total of over 52 million people infected with chronic hepatitis in the country. Out of this, 40 million people in India are chronically infected with Hepatitis B and 6 to 12 million people are chronically infected with Hepatitis C, latest assessment by the UN agency shows. The regulator has also allowed leeway to manufacturers for conducting clinical trials or bio-equivalence studies in India. While these studies are conducted to test new drugs on local patients, they take a long time and hence often delays launches in the country. The new norms issued by the regulator allows companies to apply for such studies and product approvals simultaneously, whereas usually companies have to submit data from trials before seeking product approvals. In fact, in some cases the regulator has also suggested waiving off clinical trials for urgent use. \"Clinical trial waiver for such products recommended by WHO for concomitant use may be given, as being falling under the category of extreme urgency and under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,\" it said. Though India has demonstrated a 57% reduction in overall annual number of new HIV cases, it continues to have the third highest number of people living with HIV in the world. Similarly, chronic Hepatitis is placing a huge disease, social and economic burden on affected families as well as the health system. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to liver fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Early approvals in India are also likely to benefit people around the world as India is a major supplier of generic medicines, mainly anti-retroviral."

        "body": "LUCKNOW: Doctors in UP still rely over Elisa as compared to NAT for HIV detection. \u201cElisa is used because it is cost effective and is an easily available technology. The test is sensitive to the virus and detects positive cases sooner or later,\u201d said RC Srivastava, joint director, targeted intervention, UPSACS which runs the HIVAIDS control programme in the state. Besides KGMU, NAT facility is available at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences. But neither uses it for screening of HIV. AT KGMU, which also runs an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) for HIV, NAT positive cases detected at the state blood bank are eventually referred to ICTC which sends them for confirmatory test done using Elisa. \u201cAs a result, several NAT HIV positive cases may fall under Elisa HIV negative category which is not in the interest of patients as they will eventually be detected HIV positive in afew months,\u201d said Prof Chandra. Chief medical superintendent, KGMU, Prof SN Shankhwar said they will look into the possibility of using NAT in ICTC. Times View UP State AIDS Control Society and KGMU being at variance over data regarding prevalence of HIV-AIDS in the state is a matter of serious concern. KGMU, with its advanced NAT method of blood testing, considered the gold standard, is better placed than UPSACS which is straddled with Elisa test alone. The state should work towards upgrading its infrastructure so that NAT method is introduced as soon as possible. A more realistic survey would present the correct picture, which will result in dealing with the problem with greater alacrity, reach out to more patients and bigger aid that is actually needed. If we do not accurately know how big the problem is, it\u2019s solution will always fall short of the requirement. ( Simran Tandon)"

The process of initiating every HIV positive individual on antiretroviral treatment (ART), however, has been fraught with difficulties ranging from refusals and adherence issues to side-effects. In Maharashtra, around 33,500 people were identified in the pre-ART category that includes those who are positive but not in immediate need of medicines due to good immunity levels. Out of that, the state has managed to contact around 21,000 people and initiate less than half on treatment. Earlier, ART would be given only after the CD4 levels dropped to 500. \u201cThose with higher immunity levels are reluctant to take medicines daily on the ground that they do not suffer from any symptoms. We are reaching out to them through our social workers and NGOs,\u201d said Parimal Singh, project director of Maharashtra District Aids Control Society (MSACS). The WHO had recommended the treat-all policy so that people living with HIV could lead healthier lives and cut down transmissibility. The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has been facing similar issues. Around 1,400 patients from the city have been added under the treat-all policy. \u201cAdherence is a problem that we are trying to tackle. Under the treat-all policy, even those with higher CD4 levels are started on treatment. Some of them have stopped treatment after suffering side-effects. Their contention being they were healthier before starting ART,\u201d said Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS. \u201cHowever, to prevent problems of drug resistance, we have started rigorous counselling before initiation of treatment,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator Mark Green, while speaking at an event on Friday, said, \u201cNew HIV infections in India have reduced by 66% since 2000. Today, nearly one million people are on ART and that is an extraordinary achievement you should celebrate.\u201d He added the body would continue to provide financial support and technical expertise to the programme.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES: Scientists have identified a novel antibody that could more effectively detect and neutralise HIV virus in an infected patient. Proteins called broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) are a promising key to the prevention of infection by HIV , the virus that causes AIDS. The bNAbs have been found in blood samples from some HIV patients whose immune systems can naturally control the infection. These antibodies may protect a patient's healthy cells by recognising a protein called the envelope spike, present on the surface of all HIV strains and inhibiting, or neutralising, the effects of the virus. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered that one particular bNAb may be able to recognise this signature protein, even as it takes on different conformations during infection -making it easier to detect and neutralise the viruses in an infected patient. The study was published in the journal Cell."

This comes a day ahead of World AIDS day . Since 2012, Dr Murthy said the blood bank had detected 29 cases where blood screened by ELISA test (a mandatory test for screening donated blood before transfusion) was found infected with HIV , Hepatitis B and C. \u201cThis was detected when we ran the blood samples through another advanced blood test called as Nucleic Acid Amplification Technology (NAAT), which is more sensitive than ELISA in detecting transfusion transmitted infections,\u201c he said, adding that in several cases, newborn children born free of HIV infection got infected after blood transfusion. He said there was a need for a policy rethink on the part of National Aids Control Society (NACO) as NAAT blood test was considered fool-proof in detection of HIV . \u201cThe chances of HIV infection through blood transfusion ranges between 0.5% to 3% now,\u201c he said.

He said 16 inmates were found positive for hepatitis C virus and six were suffering from venereal disease related to sexual infections. The health department conducted the camp in association with the Jind jail administration under the supervision of CMO and two other doctors, including a lady doctor. Dr Dahiya said out of the six HIV positive cases, one was an old patient already undergoing treatment while the other five had been lodged in the jail recently. The CMO also about 40 to 50 women inmates were also screened during the camp and found to be free from any ailments. He said 300 inmates were yet to be examined by the health department. He said the HIV positive inmates would have to get their treatment card made from PGIMS, Rohtak, while the district health department would start their treatment in the jail. \u201cEarlier, the HIV positive patients had to go to the antiretroviral (ART) centre in the PGIMS for treatment but now the district health team started providing the facility to them in Jind. Our unit is now linked with the ART centre of the PGIMS,\u201d Dr Dahiya said. He said the department was concerned about the health of jail inmates and would continue conducting such checkups in future. Dr Dahiya said he was not sure about how the inmates contracted the HIV-positive illness. Jind jail superintendent Harinder Singh said they used to organize such health check-up camps earlier as well. \u201cThose who were found to be HIV positive were lodged in the jail only recently.

Hundreds of tests using a prototype were carried out in the town of Kigali and returned a 95% accuracy for HIV and 76% for syphilis , the Daily Mail reported. \u201cThe idea is to make a large class of diagnostic tests accessible to patients in any setting in the world, rather than forcing them to go to a clinic to draw blood and then wait days for their results,\u201d said professor Samuel Sia, who led the team that developed the device. The mChip uses optics to read fluids by taking a single pin-prick of blood. It contains 10 detection zones which the blood passes through and then returns a positive or negative result in about 15 minutes. The result is presented in a simple colour-coded manner like pregnancy test, making it easy to use and understand"

The figure is constantly rising, especially in the high-risk age group of 15-35 years, which is basically described as the productivity period, according to health officials. There are various other factors, all of which add up to bring the second-largest city, Bilaspur, to second place with 1,992 HIV positive people. Educational hub Durg-Bhilai has 1,865 patients. In Bastar, 125 people were tested positive last year, which have increased to 79 in the first half of 2012.

The national average for adult HIV prevalence is estimated at 0.26% in 2015. Besides these states, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Tripura and Tamil Nadu have also shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence. However, the government is particularly concerned about the northeastern states because it feels the adult HIV prevalence rate in these states is driven by drug injecting people. \"The HIV epidemic in the northeastern (NE) region is primarily driven by injecting drug use and this is compounded by unsafe sexual behaviours. The porous international borders, hilly terrain, poor road and transport communications, disturbed law and order situations pose many challenges for NE states in scaling up HIV prevention, care and treatment efforts among key populations and the general population. This has adversely affected the scale and quality of services,\" an official note on Project Sunrise said. According to the note, the national average for prevalence of HIV among drug addicts is 7.14%, whereas in Manipur it is 12.9% and in Mizoram it is 12%. Project Sunrise, steered by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) under the health ministry, will also aim to create more awareness about the disease in these NE states. The project will be funded under the Centre for Disease Control and will be implemented in coordination with state AIDS control organisations and non-government organisations (NGOs) working in this area. The government also plans to employ consultants privy to local settings in these states who can help improve the outreach of various initiatives planned under the project. Other initiatives planned under the project include enhancing capacity of state-level institutions in high burden areas, community mobilisation, intervention among females injecting drugs and spouses of such people.

Remarkably, these six compounds have shown zero toxicity in fighting against HIV. The pioneering work, developed by Dr R K Singh of AU along with his research scholars and scientists from NARI, for synthesising theses six compounds is the efforts of four years of research work under the project titled 'designing and development of antiviral compound as inhibits of HIV replication' funded by department of Bio-technology (DBT) and Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). The funding agencies had pumped in a whopping amount of around Rs 11 crores which was distributed among nine institutions of the country, Singh and NARI been given Rs 60 lakhs. \"The achievement is incredible as it has the potential to revolutionise the fight against AIDS as the available drugs against AIDS, including AZT (Azido Thymidine), causes side effect by harming bone marrows whereas all these six compounds are zero toxic\", said Dr Singh. Moreover, since the compounds have been indigenously developed it would help India take a huge leap forward in combating AIDS, he adds. The compounds have been tested on the cell line of HIV at the labs of National Institute of Immunology (NAII), Delhi and NARI, Pune, he added. The achievement of the team is the tedious research work spanning from late 2006 to 2010. \"After computational study of the structure of RT (reverse transcriptase) provided by Crystallographers, we synthesized 40 compounds out of which 12 showed perfect docking-a process which provide information about the interaction between HIV enzymes and possible drug molecule. Out of these dozen compounds, which were positive against HIV, six showed no toxicity whereas the rest had little toxicity, explained Dr Singh. The associated findings of the project have been accepted in 'European journal of medicinal chemistry'. \"The lead compounds synthesized by us have successfully cleared the scanning by the experts in this field after which we have applied for the patenting of the Six compounds and the process of the same is in its final stage\", said Singh."

Soon, other HIV-positive patients, too, joined him to protest against the hospital staff. Talking to the TOI, the youth said, \u201cI had recently got an implant in my left leg, which was giving some trouble. When I went to Dr Davinder, orthopaedic surgeon of civil hospital, he refused to admit and treat me. He asked me to go back to my hometown in UP from where I got the implant.\u201d Dr US Sooch, district programme officer, HIV/ Aids prevention, said, \u201cThe patient came to me with a complaint and I told Dr Davinder to admit him. The patient also gave a complaint to Dr Meenu Singh, deputy director, Punjab State Aids Control Society. But he was not admitted.\u201d \u201cIt was only after I went on a hunger strike and an NGO, Dr Kotinis, offered help that the hospital admitted me,\u201d the youth added. Dr Inderjit from NGO Dr Kotinis said, \u201cThe HIV-positive patient has been complaining for the past five days that he is being denied treatment. Left with no option, he went on a hunger strike and didn\u2019t even take his HIV medicine. Then, the senior medical officer came and the patient was admitted. Many other HIV patients joined him in his protest and complained about doctors and nurses\u2019 misbehaviour.\u201d The protest, which started at 10am, was called off at 2pm. While refuting the allegations, senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Kulwinder Singh said, \u201cDr Davinder gave him antibiotics for five days, and he was asked to come for further treatment after the dose. We had asked the patient for his medical records. As he could not give the records, he was asked to take treatment from the doctor who did the implant. \u201cHe was never denied treatment. Every day so many HIV and hepatitis-C patients are treated, why will he be denied treatment? Moreover, he was checked in OPD and given antibiotics. But the patient wanted to be admitted, but we can\u2019t do that unnecessarily.\u201d"

The man used to be a regular at a local brothel and claimed to have contracted the disease from a sex worker. He said the woman' s son had knowingly sent over the HIV positive sex worker to him. Shanti Devi was found lying in a pool of blood outside her house in Vijay Vihar Phase-II. Her head had been crushed with a stone and she had been stabbed several times with a pointed object. \" A team led SHO Vijay Vihar was formed to look into every aspect of the case and an eyewitness was discovered,\" DCP Outer Vikramjit Singh said.

        "body": "PUNE: People living with HIV, who are dependent on the life-saving second line antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs in the city, are forced to go without it owing to the short supply of medicines. The ART centre at B J Medical College that provides second line ART drugs free of costhas been facing the shortage for a week now. There are around 60 patients who require daily dose of the drug. \"We provide the drugs free of cost to around 55 to 60 patients on designated two days in a week. Patients need to take these drugs every day,\" said a staff at the ART centre at BJMC. The hospital had to supply 3,000 tablets of retonovir, a second line ART drug, to a government medical college in Bangalore a few days ago and the supplied number of tablets were not replenished in time, resulting in short-supply, said the staff. As a result, patients visiting the centre have been going empty-handed. \"The shortage has forced us to buy the medicine in the open market. These drugs are very expensive. Many of us have stopped the life-saving drugs due to the expensess involved,\" said a HIV patient. ART is a combination of highly advanced drugs meant to fight HIV infection and increase life expectancy. If the first line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second line of drugs. Both these regimens are provided free of cost by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), the country's nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS. Mumbai's J J Hospital and the three ART sub-centres at BJ Medical College, Pune, Government Medical College, Nagpur and Government Medical College, Aurangabad, provide second line ART treatment free of cost. There are total 1,000 HIV patients who require the advanced treatment in Maharashtra. When contacted, Dilip Deshmukh, additional director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), confirmed the shortageof the drug at BJMC ART centre. \"I have received information about the short supply of the drugs. All HIV medicines are being supplied by NACO and respective state AIDS control society only oversees the distribution of these drugs. The issue will be put forth before the NACO officials. We will see that the shortage is replenished immediately,\" Deshmukh said. Officials of the NACO said the sudden increase in number of patients receiving second line of treatment has caused the shortage of these drugs. Healthcare experts and NGOs fear this would increase the number of patients dropping out of the drug regimen, causing more cases of drug resistance."

        "body": "Vadodara: Concerned over increasing number of HIV patients leaving ART therapy mid-way, SSG Hospital's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) has launched an initiative to educate the patients on ways to sustain the heavy dose of medicines administered.While the inability to sustain the side-effects of the medicine is a major reason among the patients, doctors believe that the travel to the only ART center in the region at SSG Hospital is also a challenge for many patients.\"Many patients who come into the city from the surrounding areas are from the lower-income group. They lack the nutrition level required to sustain the treatment and a majority of the patients were unable to endure ART. The side-effects of the strong doses, such as vomiting and fatigue, affect them more than those who are healthy,\" said one of the counsellors at the ICTC, citing a cause of patients being lost to follow-up.\"The ART is a long-term treatment and many times patients lose the patience to let the therapy work. In the initial few months, there is no symptomatic relief. Therefore most cases that are lost to follow-up are during these initial months,\" Dr Kedar Mehta, said researcher .The counselling sessions also include the family members of the patients in an attempt to minimize the stigma which experts believe still remain the major challenge for the treatment of the viral infection.Mehta added that stigmatisation of HIV/AIDS patients also cause many patients to stop their treatment. \"Many HIV positive patients hide their illness from relatives. As a result they do not take the regular medicines to avoid the questions,\" Mehta told TOI.According to previous studies conducted at the ART centre of the hospital, each year 19 per cent of the patients go missing after the first few sessions, leaving the treatment half way."

States such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which are larger both in area and population, have not recorded many cases. The rising numbers in the southern states are attributed to efficient screening over the last few years, said experts. \u201cThe southern states have taken AIDS awareness and prevention very seriously in the last five years. The state governments along with non-governmental organizations have ensured compulsory screening up to the village level, which has resulting in better documentation and recording of HIV cases,\u201d said Vijay Raman, deputy director of Voluntary Health Services, a non-profit multi-specialty hospital in Tamil Nadu. Though the cumulative numbers are high in the south, the number of fresh cases being recorded every year has dropped significantly since 2010.

Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also saw a sharp fall in the number of fresh cases reported every year. The drop in the number of fresh cases is due to the increasing awareness among the public, especially the risk-prone communities of sex workers, homosexuals and transgenders, said Bakthavatchalam A, deputy director of Association for Rural Mass India, a non-profit organization working in the health sector.

        "body": "The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has made it clear that India is not ready to adhere to WHO's recent recommendation of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV patients regardless of their disease stage. Till now, in India, only those with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 are started under the ART programme. The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body's immune system. \u201cWe have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,\u201c said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO's recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately . \u201cIt is expected to take a year or two,\u201c he said. With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qu alify for the free ART therapy are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently , only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people li ving with HIV in India is esti mated to be 21lakh. Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, , adolescents and children with HIV . Dr George Oomen, infec tious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best. Head of medicine at Parel's KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, \u201cThat is the way world is treating HIV . Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?\u201c He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission. Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. \u201cThere is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,\u201c he added. Rewari said PrEp is being tried as a pilot study among female sex workers in Chennai, Mysore and Kolkata."

        "body": "MUMBAI/GOA: It was Valentine\u2019s Day morning in February 1989, and Dominic D\u2019Souza, a 29-year-old living in Parra, a rural parish of north Goa, had just finished breakfast with his mother and aunt when a policeman arrived and whisked him away. Without being told why, Dominic was hustled around the police station, a hospital and badgered with questions about his sexuality and sex life until he was jolted into realising he was a carrier of the HIV virus. It\u2019s been 25 years since the country\u2019s patient zero of the dreaded scourge, who was the first to bear the brunt of ostracism and whose case became the first HIV-related one to reach the Indian courts, succumbed to AIDS. From being handcuffed and left to rot in an abandoned tuberculosis sanatorium to challenging the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of HIV-positive persons, Dominic\u2019s legal, medical and emotional journey irrevocably changed not only his own life but became a rallying cry in the struggle for equal rights to treatment and care for those with HIV in the country. Still fit at the time of arrest, Dominic had all along maintained that he was an HIV carrier but not an AIDS patient even as he was being quarantined with rats. Finally, he legally fought his way out 64 days later. On release, he lost his job but chose not to play the victim. Instead, he became India\u2019s first HIV-positive activist. Goa became a centre of AIDS activism with Dominic setting up Positive People, an NGO for the rights of the HIV-infected. Isabel de Santa-Rita Vaz, his friend who\u2019d rallied around him and continued his mission with Positive People, recounts: \u201cHis agony was unbearable for us. Dominic knew it wouldn\u2019t be possible to achieve total freedom from infection but wanted to start an organisation that could combat discrimination.\u201d Although he won a partial victory at first when the state amended the Goa Public Health Act and court made detention optional, Dominic lost his life three years on, at 33. \u201cDominic lived with AIDS, but he lived not to be ashamed,\u201d read his obituary in Goa\u2019s newspapers in 1992, in keeping with his wishes. \u201cHe is survived by his twin brother who lives in Sweden, a sister in Mombasa and another brother in the US,\u201d says Vaz. Today, there are an estimated 2.1 million HIV-positive persons in India. Even though diagnosis is no more a death sentence but a chronic illness for which medicines are easier to access, and one can live longer, regular lives, the challenges are many. The stigma it carries and its association with homosexuality, drug use and sex work still impedes the shift in people\u2019s attitudes, says Vaz, adding that the other big challenge is \u201cfunding\u201d. Yet, what happened 25 years ago changed the national conversation on the disease and laid the grounds for the HIV/AIDS Bill passed by Parliament + last month. \u201cThe dream of having an integrationist approach which requires testing with informed consent and preserving confidentiality and integration of the individual in society has been passed,\u201d says Anand Grover, Dominic\u2019s counsel, who\u2019s been fighting for HIV patients in court since he first met Dominic. \u201cWe not only became good friends but worked to oppose the Centre from adopting the Goa Public Health Act model nationally. That was India\u2019s first movement on HIV issues.\u201d The HIV/AIDS Bill passed by Parliament was drafted by Grover\u2019s Lawyers Collective. But Grover is apprehensive about the \u2018test and treat\u2019 policy of providing ART as soon as a person tests positive irrespective of his CD count or clinical stage that it introduced. \u201cIndia is still far from the goal of complying with the 500 CD count regimen even now,\u201d says Grover. Moreover, the caveat it introduced about treatment services being provided \u2018as far as possible\u2019 could be an escape route for government to evade its obligations. A lot remains to be done.\u201d Grover\u2019s resolve was predestined. In May 1992, shortly before his death, Dominic had \u201cextracted\u201d a promise from Grover. \u201cA promise I did not realize would have a profound impact on me. It was May 22, 1992. I got a call about Dominic being seriously ill and in Breach Candy hospital in Mumbai. I rushed there. The otherwise handsome young man was skin and bones, but he was only interested in what I was doing for HIV issues. Whether by design or accident, it became a promise that I\u2019d continue doing legal work for HIV rights.\u201d The cases he handles now are primarily about access to medicines, discrimination and negligence of health care workers.

        "body": "CHENNAI: In a survey conducted among 986 HIV-positive women in 13 high-prevalence districts across Tamil Nadu, it was found that a shocking 48% of them had no knowledge about contraceptives. The survey, which analysed the reporductive, child and sexual health needs of women living with HIV/AIDS in the state, also showed that over 60% of them had never heard of cervical cancer and pap smear tests even though HIV-positive women are more susceptible to cervical and breast cancer. As many as 70% of the women surveyed were daily wage laboureres and belonged to the lower economic class with a monthly income of less than Rs 5,000 a month. More than half the women were not aware of the various sexually transmitted infections (STI) and only 3% of the women could guess that an STI was a problem related to the genitals. The survey also revealed that most HIV-positive women (60.4%) did not share information on STIs with their adolescent children and had inhibitions about discussing about sex and sexuality with their children. The results of the survey were released during a four-day leadership training programme for HIV positive women from 10 states organised by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) along with the Positive Women Network (PWN). The programme hopes to address the various issues faced by HIV positive women across the country such as those related to property, violence, livelihood and sexual health. As many as 27 women from various states participated in the event and presented case studies about the various problems faced by the HIV-positive women in their respective states. The authors of 15 best case studies will be given a one-time stipend of Rs 20,000 to implement their ideas within a period of three months. \"In Tamil Nadu, one of the major issues is of women not having property rights. It is important for a HIV-positive woman to have some property to support her. If my case study is chosen, I will work towards raising awareness about this issue,\" said D Padmavathy, president of Tamil Nadu PWN. Varsha Gaekwad, president of Maharashtra PWN, said that issues of reproductive health plagued women in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat and she hoped to address these issues and conduct awareness camps for women in the state about cervical cancer, breast cancer and other sexually transmitted diseases."

The Foundation had set up four hospitals across South India two years ago, to curb the spread of HIV in the region. They were established at Bagalkot (Karnataka), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Tiruchi (Kerala) and Kakinada (Tamil Nadu). The US-based Global Foundation For AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had given financial support for the treatment of patients suffering from these three major diseases. A Chennai-based voluntary organization, Population of India, took help from the Foundation to set up these hospitals, which came as a boon to HIV-infected persons. The Bagalkot hospital, which started out in a rented house in Godi, on Muchakhandi Road, served patients from North Karnataka. The hospital had a 50-bed capacity. More than 4,157 HIV-affected people have been treated in this hospital till today, but fatalities have been a mere 400. The main reason for the hospital shutting down is that GFATM announced that it would discontinue funding. The agreement contract was not renewed from March 31, 2010. The closure procedure began on March 15, with patients being shifted to the government hospital. Equipment worth Rs 30 lakh was returned to the parent organization. It has also affected 32 staff working here, but it is patients who are worst hit. While the government is thinking of opening a separate section in the district hospital, it remains to be seen if these patients can be served round-the-clock and as efficiently. Several NGOs, social workers and industrialists approached the elected representatives to keep the hospital going, but till today, there has been no response from the authorities. Bagalkot district has a high number of HIV-positive patients, and with the closure of the hospital, the ball is now in the government's court."

Revealing these grim statistics on the eve of World Aids Day, observed on December 1, experts on Friday rued how the HIV epidemic continues to be a major public health challenge in the state. Within AP, Kadapa tops the chart owing to the widespread HIV prevalence among pregnant women and is closely followed by East Godavari, Karimnagar, Guntur, Krishna and Mahbubnagar districts. In Hyderabad, the prevalence rate is around 0.75%, which is only marginally lesser than the state average of 0.77%, statistics revealed. While officials of AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) maintain that the number of new infections reported from the state has dropped from 25,749 in 2008 to 23,905 in 2009, they say that AP still has a long way to go before it can weed out the issue and see a significant decline in HIV cases. Among High Risk Groups (HRGs) too, doctors indicate, the HIV rate has seen a considerable drop. Between 2006 and 2009, the number of people infected have come down by an approximate 23%. According to recent statistics, currently the prevalence rate is 7.1% among female sex workers, 10.1% among men having sex with men, 3% among injectable drug users and 3.2% among long distance truckers. \"AP has been disproportionately impacted by HIV/Aids epidemic as one-fifth of the estimated PLHAs in the country are from here,\" said Dr Jaya Krishna, state epidemiologist, APSACS, which has 4.02 lakh HIV positive cases registered with it. Experts also stressed on the need for integrated service to treat HIV and TB simultaneously as Tuberculosis, they said, was the leading killer of people tested positive for HIV."

        "body": "PANAJI: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART), a medication to decelerate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved effective for over 250 HIV+ children in Goa, the problem is far from over. In fact, doctors and NGOs dealing with HIV+ adolescents are faced with new problems, such as how to explain and make HIV-affected children understand that they need to lead a controlled life as they become adults. That they will not be able to enjoy life on par with their counterparts. Many of them think \u201cbeing HIV\u201d means they will die soon and are in a hurry to live life to the fullest extent such as partying hard or being in a relationship. Dr Vanda Viegas, senior medical officer at ART center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, said though they have had good results with children, who were put on ART since the centre started in the year 2005, they are now posed with more complex problems. \u201cThe problem is getting more complicated as most are orphans brought up in the orphanages and are now on their own,\u201d she said. They have similar urges and desires like other adolescents of their age, but, the only difference is that they have a deadly ailment. There is also a tendency among HIV-positive children to give up education once they learn about their disease. \u201cThey want to freak out and do everything possible before death catches up with them,\u201d said Viegas. Though some may be keen to do higher studies, she said they might not excel for the disease is likely to affect their IQ. Few are into college education, nonetheless. Peter Borges, secretary, Positive People, an NGO working for people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, said life for such children is not easy. Last week, a three-day workshop was held in Valpoi for HIV children,, who were informed about their ailment and were counselled on various aspects. They were also informed about various career options and how to go about it, and also given tips on stress management. A counsellor, who has been counselling HIV patients, for a while, said counselling children with HIV is a tough job. Children with no parents or parents or a guardian going astray are high once they grasp the magnitude of their disease fully. \u201cThey want to be like other youth. Though we do warn them about perils of their action, we suspect some get into relationship without revealing to their partners about their ailment,\u201d he said. Viegas said, in recent times, she has come across three-four cases wherein relatives of HIV-positive girls got them married outside Goa. \u201cIn none of the cases, the groom or his family was informed about the HIV status of the bride,\u201d she pointed out. The end result has been tragic. After marriage, the girls stopped taking ART to hide the disease, and consequently progression of HIV virus in them was faster. \u201cThey wanted to hide their ailment from their families, but, the arrangement didn\u2019t work. They were thrown out by their respective families,\u201d she pointed out. When some reported back at the ART center, they were in stage four, with full blown AIDS."

New cases of HIV among gay and bisexual men fell by almost a third to the lowest on record, according to the world\u2019s first study to measure the impact of Gilead Sciences Inc's Truvada pill on reducing the AIDS-causing virus in a large population. The results, published Thursday in the Lancet HIV medical journal, may pave the way for other states and countries to stop transmission of the virus with the use of a treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. \"The speed of the decline we\u2019ve seen in new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men is a world first,\" said study leader Andrew Grulich, head of HIV epidemiology and prevention at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales. \"These numbers are the lowest on record since HIV surveillance began in 1985.\" Progress against AIDS over the past 15 years has inspired a commitment by UN member states to end the epidemic by 2030. The number of people newly infected with HIV fell to 1.8 million worldwide in 2017, from more than 3 million a year through most of the 1990s. While the study results can\u2019t be generalized to indicate similar efficacy in heterosexual populations, they do demonstrate that PrEP is \"highly cost-effective\" in certain high-risk groups, Grulich said in a phone interview. New HIV infections occurred in 102 gay and bisexual men in the state of New South Wales in the first year after the study began, compared with 149 infections in the 12 months prior. \"While we\u2019ve known for at least three or four years now of individual-level efficacy of PrEP, there has been some reticence around the world by policy makers to properly fund the roll out of PrEP because the population impact hasn\u2019t been shown -- and that\u2019s what we set out to do,\" Grulich said. There were about 180,000 people in the US taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of June, Robin L. Washington, Gilead\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a conference call in July. The blue, oval-shaped pill is a fixed-dose combination of the drugs tenofovir, disoproxil and emtricitabine. Generic versions of Truvada made by Mylan NV, Cipla Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. have made the medication available more cheaply. \"We see the nice steady growth of Truvada for the use of PrEP,\" Gilead\u2019s Chief Executive Officer John F. Milligan told the Morgan Stanley Global Health Care Conference last month. Areas of the US with the highest uptake of PrEP had achieved some of the best reductions in HIV infections, he said. \"I\u2019m more confident now that the policymakers are being very innovative in thinking about how to increase access to PrEP,\" Milligan said. \"So we\u2019ll be working on a number of things in the coming year that could really increase the number of patients on PrEP and could be very good for preventing the infection, and of course good for our business as well.\""

        "body": "BENGALURU: The prevalence of HIV positivity among TB patients in Karnataka is the third highest in the country. According to the India Tuberculosis 2018 report released recently, 8% of the TB patients suffer from HIV infection and are aware of the condition. \u201cHIV infection increases the risk of progression of latent TB infection to active TB disease, increasing the risk of death if not treated timely,\u201d it adds. The highest prevalence of HIV among TB patients has been recorded by Nagaland (14%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (10%). One of the reasons why Karnataka is in the third position is emphasis given to the testing of HIV status of TB patients, say doctors with the state health and family welfare department. When it comes to total TB patients notified in the country, Karnataka is in the 10th position (81,187). Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 3,11,041 cases. When the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is considered, Uttar Pradesh reports only 1%, indicating poor testing. Bagalkot tops list Bagalkot district tops the list of HIV prevalence among TB patients in Karnataka at 30%. It is followed by Belagavi (15%), indicating that TB care needs to be more focused on north Karnataka. Dharwad, Raichur and Udupi have 11% TB patients suffering from HIV. Dr Ramachandra Bairy, joint director, tuberculosis control programme, health and family welfare department, said early detection helps in controlling the infection. \u201cIn Karnataka, all HIV positive persons are tested for TB during their regular monthly antiretroviral therapy (ART) sessions. Likewise, all TB patients are tested for HIV infection,\u201d he said. If people living with HIV have cough that persist for more than two weeks and develop any gland in neck, they are immediately referred for TB testing, he added."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Researchers have developed a dissolvable tampon-like product that can carry substantial loads of medicine and could offer fast-acting HIV protection. Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) have developed the material which is capable of carrying substantial loads of medicine, dissolving and releasing the drugs once its comes into contact with moisture. The study builds on research conducted at UW's Department of Bioengineering in 2012. Dr Kim Woodrow and her team were experimenting with electrospinning, a process where a charged fluid containing polymers and antiretroviral drugs is projected from a syringe and through an electric field. The electric field causes the jet of liquid to break into tiny fibres, each measuring anywhere between 100 to several thousand nanometres, 'Gizmag' reported. These then come to land on a collecting plate and combine to form a stretchy fabric capable of blocking sperm and, as the researchers discovered, carrying and releasing contraceptives and antivirals. Because certain elements of the material can be controlled, such as the solubility, strength and size of the fibres, the researchers said that it may prove more versatile than other anti-HIV technologies currently in development. One sample dissolved within minutes, an application that could protect against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Another sample dissolved over several days, which could prove useful in sustained delivery of drugs, such as birth-control pills and anti-HIV medicines. The team said that the electrospun material can carry a large load of maraviroc, an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV which has minimal side effects. The research is published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy."

        "body": "NEW YORK: In a breakthrough which may pave the way for a vaccine against AIDS, scientists have provided what they claim is the first-ever glimpse of the structure of a key protein, gp120, found on surface of a subgroup of HIV-1. In addition, the scientists from California Institute of Technology demonstrated that a particular antibody to gp120 makes contact not only with the protein, but with CD4 receptor that gp120 uses to gain entrance into the body's T cells. This three-dimensional understanding of how gp120 is built is more than just a basic scientific advance, they say. \"There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120. Having more structural information will facilitate better vaccine design,\" said lead scientist Ron Diskin. The team looked specifically at gp120 from what is known as clade C HIV-1. To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades. Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is \"the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,\" said Diskin. \"It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide.\" In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true \u2014 the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c."

Caf\u00e9 Positive, an entrepreneurship project by the 10 HIV-positive boys and girls, became operational at a 12 feet by 10 feet garage space at 524 Jodhpur Park in south Kolkata. The youths struggled managing the sudden rush on Day 1at the caf\u00e9 that saw a huge acceptance from the Jodhpur Park neighbourhood as people started coming in and congratulating the young owners for their grit, determination and initiative while having caf\u00e9 latte or iced tea. TimesViewInitiatives like this are necessary to dispel perceptions that have no basis in reality. It takes a lot of courage to swim against the tide. We hope this example will prompt more such efforts. \u201cI had read about the youths in the newspapers and empathised with them in their struggle. That they have finally found a place and that too in our neighbourhood feels great. Had I had a place to offer, I would have come forward and helped them long ago,\u201d said Sharmistha Mitra, a resident of a Jodhpur Park apartment and one of the first few customers at the caf\u00e9. TOI had first reported on March 5 how six boys and four girls, who had undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail preparations, aspired to start their own coffee shop at some location in south Kolkata but were turned down by house owners. For youths like Sathi Biswas (name changed), Susanta Pal (name changed) and eight others who overcame the hurdles for almost a year, it was a dream come true moment. \u201cWe were turned down by so many house owners that at one point of time we had started wondering if we can at all open the caf\u00e9. But we are glad that the day has finally come,\u201d said Biswas, serving Espresso and muffins to two new patrons. Helping them out was Kallol Ghosh, the brain behind the caf\u00e9 and the founder of Anandaghar, where the teenagers were brought up. \u201cIt\u2019s a day I have been dreaming for long. We had faced strange reasons from people for refusing space to these teenagers. While some said their family members were not ready, others said people in the neighbourhood wouldn\u2019t allow them to run a business with HIV-positive patients. But finally the day has come when the ten have found the platform to break the myths surrounding the disease,\u201d said Ghosh, who runs an NGO, Offer. Actor Parambrata Chatterjee, who was also present at the inauguration, said: \u201cI was disheartened when I came to know that a city like Kolkata was hesitant to give an opportunity to them. Now that they have made it, I am really glad and hope the people turn up in large numbers to taste the delicacies prepared by the youths.\u201d"

Dr I S Gilada, who heads an AIDS clinic at Grant Road, told TOI that a 29-year-old woman from the Western suburbs has been visiting him since the past two months. While counselling her, the doctor learnt that she not only has multiple partners, but hunts for them with a vengeance to spread the virus she contracted through her husband. \"She was brought to us by her sister, who herself is HIV positive,\" said Gilada. \"We found out that she had learnt of her husband's HIV-positive status in 2005, and that he had transmitted the disease to her as well. Although she divorced him, she couldn't come to terms with the fact that he had knowingly passed on the virus to her,\" he said. Gilada said that during the counselling sessions, the woman, who works as a maid, claimed she has had more than 300 sexual encounters with 100 men over the past three years. \"She admitted to frequent encounters with men ranging from her employers and their relatives, to the liftman and students - all of whom have had unprotected sex with her,\" said Gilada. When asked about the case, Dr S S Kudalkar, president at the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), said the organization would investigate the matter. \"We will talk to the clinic and investigate the case. If it is true, then we will counsel the woman,\" he said. \"HIV is not just a disease of the virus, it is also a disease of human behaviour. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has mandated pre-test and post-test counselling to curb patients from forging sexual contacts with multiple partners,\" said Dr Kudalkar."

In the absence of testing kits, blood that has been collected from donors cannot be utilized for patients. The public blood banks in the city get their testing kits from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which purchases them centrally. In November, most blood banks have not received their supply and are scrambling to make last-minute purchases locally. It is feared that the existing shortage of blood in the city may be aggravated by the lack of testing kits as even if blood is collected it cannot be given to patients without certifying it as infection-free. Staffers from several blood banks, including Cama and Albless, St George, GT, have confirmed that they have run out of testing kits. Dean of Parel\u2019s KEM Hospital Dr Avinash Supe said that since the kits have not come, they have purchased locally. The Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) distributes kits on behalf of the NACO to the city blood banks. Supe said, \u201cMDACS has not provided us kits.

This came to light during a media sensitization workshop in Shimla wherein HIV positive people shared life experiences. The workshop was organized by Mamta Health Institute for Mother and Child, New Delhi, in collaboration with Himachal Pradesh State AIDS Control Society and Himachal Pradesh Voluntary Health Association. Shreshtha (name changed), a woman from Kangra district, was thrown out of her house by her in-laws on coming to know about her HIV status. This despite the fact that she was infected by her husband, a truck driver and was forced to live in misery along with her two children. However, she was lucky to get help of village panchayats and a local NGO. Today, she is heading an organization that works in association with panchayati raj institutions to create awareness about HIV positive people. In 2011, she was also awarded the best social worker award. Bhago (name changed), another HIV positive woman from Kangra district, was passed on the infection by her husband. However, the damage catapult as by the time she came to know about her being HIV positive, she had three children from the marriage. She earns her livelihood by working as daily wager and fear of being stigmatized by the society is not letting her reveal her status. Women alone are not the ones to suffer. Sohan Lal (name changed) from Bilaspur was detected with HIV in 1990, but till date he has not revealed his being HIV positive to his relatives and villagers as he fears to he will be ostracized once he reveals the truth. \"I could reveal this to my family members only after five years,\" he added. Himachal Pradesh health director Dr D S Gurung said that 30 NGOs are working for HIV positive people in the state. He said drug abuse is increasing in border areas of the state and that is leading increasing cases of HIV too. He said that recently a meeting was held in which a proposal to provide pension to HIV positive people and bus passes for free travel for treatment was discussed too. A health official said that female sex workers are being provided vocation training and 550 have already been included under livelihood training. Vocation training to them would be provided at Industrial Training Institutes of Nahan, kala Amb, Solan, Bilaspur, Mandi, Shimla, Nalagrh and Baddi. Himachal's challenge Though Himachal Pradesh falls under the category of low prevalent state where the infection rate among the adult HIV prevalence is 0.17% with total count of positive persons at 8,091, efforts are on to nail down the causes that are resulting in spread of HIV/AIDS. As unprotected sex contributes 88% in the spread of HIV/AIDS, efforts are being made to rehabilitate female sex workers operating in the state. Official sources informed that around 10,000 female sex workers are operating in Himachal Pradesh, of which around 6,900 are working with the NGOs for their rehabilitation."

The discovery, which allows for a combination of decitabine and gemcitabine to be delivered in pill form, marks a major step forward in patient feasibility for the drugs, which previously had been available solely via injection or intravenous therapy (IV), researchers said. \u201cIf you have a condition that requires you to take a medication everyday, as many patients with HIV do, you wouldn't want to have to take that medication via daily injection ,\u201d said Steven Patterson, professor at the Center for Drug Design at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThis finding is a big step in this treatment as it could be taken as a pill, similar to other HIV drugs, and is suitable for eventual clinical translation,\u201d said Patterson. Researchers first announced decitabine and gemcitabine could potentially combine to treat HIV in August 2010. The drug combination was shown to work by lethal mutagenesis that could obliterate HIV by causing the virus to mutate to a point where it was no longer infectious. For some patients, HIV\u2019s ability to quickly mutate and evolve can result in drug resistance, researchers said."

        "title": "Russian activists struggle to raise HIV awareness as epidemic grows",
        "body": "MOSCOW: Vadim Pokrovsky stunned hundreds of students at a conference in Moscow last week when he reached into his pocket and took out a condom. \"And you, the young generation, how do you protect yourselves from HIV?\" said Pokrovsky, the 61-year-old head of Russia's federal AIDS centre. \"I always have a condom on me. Today even a 90-year-old can contract the virus.\" The audience fell silent for a moment before breaking into applause. Despite the efforts of activists like Pokrovsky, the total number of registered HIV cases in Russia exceeded one million in late 2015, with authorities struggling to contain an epidemic that experts say could be curbed by increased funding and more awareness campaigns. Pokrovsky has been openly critical of the Kremlin's policies promoting traditional family values, saying they have failed to halt the spread of the deadly virus. \"In 2015 alone, some 100,000 new HIV cases were reported in Russia,\" Pokrovsky told AFP. \"This is a very high rate, maybe the highest in Europe.\" The Russian government's policy focuses on treatment while neglecting prevention drives such as sex education in schools, with the number of people infected with the virus soaring as a result, say experts. A public health campaign in Moscow last year urged people to be faithful to their partners, rather than promoting condom use. \"Young people here often don't even know what HIV is and don't understand its dangers,\" said Moscow-based student Darya Belimova who joined Pokrovsky to address more than a thousand young people at the conference. The gathering was part of the \"Stop HIV/AIDS\" prevention campaign spanning more than 200 universities. Although the Russian health and education ministries support \"Stop HIV/AIDS\", activists and volunteers say they are fighting a lonely battle against Russia's AIDS epidemic as the virus increasingly affects the heterosexual population. The World Health Organization last year said that Russia accounted for 60 percent of all HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014, with heterosexual sex the main route of transmission of the virus which is spread through contact with contaminated body fluids. The number of HIV-positive minors which stood at 9,792 in 2015 has also jumped 8.5 percent compared to the previous year. In most of these cases an HIV-positive mother transmitted the virus to the child at birth, said Pokrovsky. \"In Russia, there is not enough public financing to support the fight against HIV at a national scale, and HIV prevention programmes for drug addicts practically don't exist,\" he said. There are just a few dozen NGOs working to fight the epidemic, spread across 40 Russian cities. \"For Russia, this is a very small number,\" Pokrovsky said. Organizations like the Andrey Rylkov Foundation which runs an outreach programme for drug users in Moscow, handing out clean needles and condoms receive no government funding. The vast size of the country also presents a challenge for effective prevention, with far-flung corners of the federation like Siberia particularly badly affected. Russia also bans methadone replacement therapy for drug addicts, which would allow users to avoid injections, eliminating the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated syringes. Many Russian NGOs, including those working on HIV prevention among drug addicts, have been under increased pressure since the reelection of President Vladimir Putin to a third term in 2012. Shortly after he was sworn in once again, the government passed a law allowing authorities to brand groups engaging in broadly-defined \"political activity\" that receive foreign funding as \"foreign agents\". The legislation was passed soon after huge anti-Putin protests rocked Moscow, and Kremlin critics see the law as a way to muzzle the strongman's critics and tighten his grip on power. In April, a court ordered that Sotsium, an HIV prevention NGO based in the southwestern city of Saratov, be labelled \"foreign agents\" after it received 1.5 million rubles ($22,400) in foreign funding to conduct a survey among drug addicts and people with HIV. \"Until recently, society wasn't really aware of the magnitude of the problem,\" said Sergei Smirnov, vice-chair of the Foundation for Social and Cultural Initiatives, the organization behind the \"Stop HIV/AIDS\" campaign. If the growth of HIV infections remains steady until 2021, Russia will face a so-called \"generalized epidemic,\" the foundation warns. An epidemic becomes \"generalized\" when HIV prevalence exceeds one percent in pregnant women nationwide, Pokrovsky said. \"This rate now stands at 0.8 percent,\" he said. \"But if it increases, the risk of a serious epidemic is very high.\""

        "body": "BENGALURU: Aishwarya (name changed) was a sex worker living on the edge of penury. She, however, didn\u2019t become a victim of HIV. Fighting stigma, she groomed her self-confidence and started saving for her sons\u2019 education. Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering. Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan. The initiative focuses on integrating biological and behavioural aspects of target groups and empowering them with peer education. Avahan has been described as a \u201csterling example\u201d in the recent report released by the joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS). Between 2003-12, the project, funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and University of Manitoba in Canada, reached out to 65,000 sex workers and over 25,000 sexual minorities. As per a survey, the findings of which were reported in British Medical Journal, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka reduced from 19.6% to 10.8% and of syphilis (another sexually transmitted disease) from 5.9% to 2.4%, with the increased use of condoms. Avahan, which targeted 16 districts of Karnataka, was credited for the achievement. \u201cWe got an identity. We ensured that we protected ourselves even while in the job. I am now into counselling and am leading a better life. I was able to save money for my children\u2019s education,\u201d said Aishwarya, who is no longer in sex work. What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project. According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012. The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members\u2019 empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7. With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. \u201cWe set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don\u2019t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,\u201d said Mohan. In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. \u201cAvahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,\u201d added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention. No mean feat To win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn\u2019t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn\u2019t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections.

        "body": "NEW DELHI: A simple blood test is now helping India identify the status of children born to HIV positive mothers as early as six weeks after their birth, instead of 18 months. Till recently, paediatricians in India, on detection of anti-HIV antibodies in children below 18 months, could never tell for sure whether they were already infected or the antibodies were transferred to them from their mother. Therefore, doctors couldn't even start the life-saving Anti-Retroviral Treatment -- the only effective way to treat HIV -- on them. This, according to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), led to 33,000 new infants getting the infection every year from their HIV positive mothers. India, in March, rolled out the highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the four high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Available in 767 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and 180 ART centres, the DNA PCR can test the blood sample of a child after it reaches six weeks of age and accurately say whether it is already infected with HIV or not. The antibody test available before March could only confirm the HIV status after the child reached 18 months of age. In the last three months, 45 children have been tested for HIV status. NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year. \"As soon as the child of an HIV positive mother is older than six weeks, his or her blood sample is collected and transported to seven national labs for testing with DNA PCR which gives us a definitive diagnosis on the child's HIV status. The report is available in just a week,\" NACO's ART chief Dr B B Rewari told TOI before leaving for the International AIDS Conference in Vienna. Dr Rewari, who will present this data in Vienna, added, \"Usually, if such children aren't put on treatment, 50% of them die within the first year of birth if infected. So early diagnosis and treatment is vital.\" Till now, India has detected 19,000 children with HIV. Unlike other tests, the HIV DNA PCR test does not rely on the presence of antigens or antibodies in the blood for diagnosis. Instead, it identifies genetic material by highlighting sequences of the virus within the subject's DNA. Experts say all babies born to mothers with HIV are born with HIV antibodies. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are about 18 months old. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are three months old by using DNA PCR test. \"The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIV test, and is not used in the standard HIV testing of adults. It looks for the presence of HIV itself, not antibodies,\" a NACO official said. When a woman is tested HIV positive, she is offered special medical care to reduce the risk of her baby being infected. Some pregnant women with HIV decide to have their baby. Others choose to have a termination. \"There are now very effective drugs that can reduce the risk of an HIV positive mother passing the virus to her baby in the womb or at birth. Delivery by elective Caesarean section also reduces the risk of a baby becoming infected. Beast-feeding in such cases increases the risk of the baby becoming infected,\" the official said. * An estimated 22.7 lakh Indians are infected with HIV * India has an HIV prevalence of 0.29% * It usually takes 10 years for HIV to become full blown AIDS * The first AIDS case in India was reported from Chennai, in 1986 * Globally, more than 33 million people have AIDS or HIV, half of them women * Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981, 60 million people have got infected with HIV and at least 25 million have died of AIDS"

A spokesman of education department said that at present the said children are studying in government schools. Department officer said that in case the alleged school was found guilty of discrimination, strict action would be taken against it. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 clearly states that a child suffering from disability has the right to pursue free education. The state education departments rules also mandates admission without any discrimination. According to NGO Drone Foundation, which looks after these children, the kids are treated poorly at their school and the teacher in-charge of the government-run school warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest. The children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009. Though the school administration was supportive in the beginning, due to pressure from parents of other children and teachers, they asked us to make alternate arrangement for their education in August, said Sunita Gupta, chairperson of Drone Foundation. Principal of DPS, Maruti Kunj, Rachna Pandit said that the children were never admitted to the school. Such children need special care. We talked to doctors and finally decided to drop them as we do not have expertise in dealing with such cases, said Pandit."

        "body": "Coimbatore: Apparel exports are finally turning a corner. With the rupee depreciating sharply against the dollar, apparel exports, which fell 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the first four months of 2018-19 (FY19), have slipped by only 1% in US dollar terms in July. Incidentally, apparel exports grew by 6% y-o-y in rupee terms during the same month. Ratings agency ICRA expects India\u2019s apparel exports to grow at a modest pace of 1%-2% for the rest of the 2019 fiscal. Though India\u2019s apparel exports are likely to remain subdued in the near-term, the worst appears to be over, the agency said. With faster GST (Goods and Services Tax) refunds, improved clarity on the rate of export incentives and the sharp rupee depreciation \u2014 witnessed over the past few months \u2014 most of the industry\u2019s concerns have been addressed to a large extent. \u201cThe fall in the rupee is helping apparel exports and the downslide has been arrested,\u201d said Sanjay Jain, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). \u201cGovernment policies are more tuned towards aiding the apparel sector. We expect a 5%-7% growth in apparel exports in the current fiscal,\u201d he said.\u201cThe depreciation in the currency (rupee) has supported the recovery (in exports),\u201d said Raja M Shanmugham, president, Tirupur Exporters\u2019 Association. The rupee depreciated 5% between April and July this year and by over 9% so far in 2018. \u201cThe signs are quite positive. The trade war between the US and China would also help in growing our exports,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the start of this year, apparel exports have been slowing down mainly due to tough competition from other Asian countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh owing to China\u2019s loss of export market share, liquidity challenges, currency fluctuations and uncertainty in policy changes,\u201d said Pushkar Mukewar, co-founder and co-CEO, Drip Capital. \u201cWith several internal as well as external headwinds, the past year turned out to be rather challenging for India\u2019s apparel exporters. Transition to the new taxation regime, besides posing liquidity challenges for the industry, added to uncertainties because of alternating stances on export incentives during the year,\u201d said Jayanta Roy, senior vice president and group head, ICRA.\u201cGoing forward, steps taken by the government to address these concerns, will remain crucial for apparel exporters to capitalise on the revived global apparel trade as well as the continuing loss of market share by China, which opens up a lucrative opportunity for key players such as India, Vietnam and Bangladesh,\u201d he said."

        "body": "MUMBAI: Amid apprehensions of diminishing global funds slowing down HIV prevention initiatives, the city has achieved a feat of sorts by bringing down the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) mortality to two this year. This is not only an 86% dip from the previous year, but also the lowest ever in the city since prevention initiatives kicked in 14 years ago. The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) made the figures public in the wake of World Aids Day on December 1. There has also been a visible difference in the number of people suffering from AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV when the infection becomes life threatening. This year, 416 have got AIDS as opposed to 790 last year. Experts say the city has come a long way from 2004 when there was a jump in the figures with nearly 278 deaths. However, the state figures still paint a grim picture about the lurking danger of HIV given that as 1,243 lives were lost to the deadly virus till October this year. Though there is a decline in the number of casualties as compared to last year, AIDS clearly claimed more lives in the state than malaria, dengue and H1N1 put together. For the city though, there has been a decline even in the number of fresh cases. This year 9,973 people have tested positive for HIV as compared to 12,944 cases in 2011. Though the difference in dip may be less than 1% between the two years, it has surely halved as compared to the situation five years back. In the past three years, over 2 lakh people have been walked into the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) out of which 5-8% have tested positive for HIV. This year too, out of 2.01 lakh Mumbaikars who got tested, around 5% were positive. MDACS additional project director Dr Balkrishna Adsul attributed the dip in positive cases and deaths to better awareness among citizens and integrated approach by agencies. \"We are now aiming towards zero positive cases and deaths,\" he said. Adsul said most of those who tested positive are in the 20-30 years agegroup. The MDACS figures also show a trend where more pregnant women are approaching the ICTC centres for testing and counselling. This year, 1.03 lakh pregnant women got tested for HIV out of which 365 tested positive. But, on the positive side, more children also seem to be getting Nevirapine, drug administered to babies born of HIV positive moms, soon after birth. Officially, the numbers say that 88.9% babies have received the drug that reduces their chances of getting HIV from 30% to around 12-15%. An expert, however, maintained that unregistered deliveries still remain a grey area. While, agencies fighting HIV/AIDS are rejoicing with Mumbai, still regarded as the epicentre, gaining significantly over the disease, experts have a words of caution. One of the experts told TOI, \"Fresh infections have been coming down in the general population for a while now but what about high-risk groups like female sex workers, men having sex with men (MSM), truckers and other vulnerable groups. Those numbers would also be crucial.\""

        "body": "MYSURU: The three Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres in Mysuru have detected 810 HIV cases this year. In Mysuru district alone, they have detected 725 cases. In Mysuru district, about 14,000 HIV positive patients are registered at the three centres and 5,500 people are undergoing treatment, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officer Dr T Raghukumar said here on Monday. Speaking at a World AIDS Day event at JSS Nursing College, he said more patients are visiting the ART Centres for treatment due to awareness among public on HIV. Patients, including from neighbouring districts, have been undergoing treatment in the ART centres at Krishna Rajendra Hospital, Asha Kirana Hospital and JSS Hospital. Till October end this year, the centres tested 51,728 people, 776 of whom tested positive. Out of the 30,112 pregnant women tested, 37 were detected with HIV, he added. Treating pregnant women The centres are treating HIV positive pregnant women with a CD-4 cell count of 350 plus. The anti-retroviral course begins in the 14th week of pregnancy and goes on till they stop breast feeding. Besides, tests are conducted on infants four times till they reach 18 months of age, a doctor said. To create awareness among students, the DAPCU has set up 70 red ribbon clubs in pre-university and degree colleges in the district and 13 blood banks are functioning across the district. Public care can help them live longer HIV patients feel they can live long if they get proper care, love and affection from society. They also feel that self confidence plays a major role in it. Kantaraju, a HIV patient who runs an NGO, said patients must have self-confidence. Kantharaju, who tested HIV positive in 2008, runs 'Ananda Jyoti' to helps others get proper treatment and benefits from the government. He said the government has been providing free treatment for HIV positive people. Pointing out that nutritious food is as important as treatment and medicines, Kantaraju urged the government to offer free food for patients as many belong to poor and backward families. Another HIV patient from Hunsur, who did not wish to reveal her name, said, \"Though we did not know how we got affected, many look at us as if we had done something horrible. I have lost all hopes in life. I am living only for my children.\" She was detected with HIV in 2010, and has undergoing treatment at the ART Centre at Krishnarajendra Hospital since then. \"If people like me get moral support from neighbours, we can lead a normal happy life,\" she added."

        "body": "MUMBAI: In tune with the global trend, the HIV/AIDS epidemic appears to be slowing down in Mumbai as well. For decades the city was infamous for being the HIV capital of India, but figures available with the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society show that for the third consecutive year the HIV incidence is falling. If 5,420 AIDS cases were registered in 2007, there were only 2,942 cases in 2008 and 1,308 cases in 2009. \"So far this year, we have registered 966 cases,\" said MDACS chief Dr S S Kudalkar, adding that the epidemic is clearly on the wane. The city has many reasons to cheer on the HIV/AIDS front. Many of the indicators that are used to assess the epidemic's spread in the general population show a downward trend. The virus is lower than ever before among pregnant women, dipping from 1.24% in 2005 to 0.53% in the first 10 months of 2010. Public health experts say this unsuspecting segment provides the best indicator of the disease's presence in the general population. People who queue up voluntarily to donate blood provide another indicator of HIV's presence in the society: seropositivity has fallen from 1.06% in 2002 to 0.46% in 2009. In the period up to October 2010, only 903 from 2,19,332 donors tested positive for HIV. \"This means only 0.41% were positive,\" said Kudalkar. But the statistic that the MDACS director is most pleased about is the dipping number of deaths among HIV-positive people whose disease progressed to full-blown AIDS. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, say in 2004, the death rate stood at 8.67% among the 3,205 AIDS patients identified that year. This year, the rate has fallen to 3.7%\u2014that is, 36 deaths among 966 patients. \"It is obvious that with better availability of ART (anti-retro viral therapy), patients are leading healthier and longer lives than before,\" said Kudalkar. The downward trend in Mumbai is not surprising as the recently released United Nations AIDS organization's figures show. Globally, HIV infection rates have fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 from 3.1 million in 1999. Also, AIDS-related deaths have come down by 20% in the same period across the world. UNAIDS showed that India has 2.4 million HIV patients at present. The only factor clouding the happy picture is the fact that though seven lakh HIV-positive Indians need ART, less than half have access to it. In Mumbai, ART access improved only because more centres started distributing the life-saving drugs in the last few years. In Mumbai, MDACS statistics show that 24,086 of 52,828 HIV-positive patients registered for care in the city received ART in the period between 2006 and 2010."

        "body": "LONDON: Scientists have found a new strategy to starve the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to death - by blocking its sugar and nutrient pipeline. HIV has a voracious sweet tooth, which turns out to be its Achilles' heel, according to researchers from Northwestern Medicine and Vanderbilt University. After the virus invades an activated immune cell, it craves sugar and nutrients from the cell to replicate and fuel its wild growth throughout the body. READ ALSO: HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds Scientists discovered the switch that turns on the immune cell's abundant sugar and nutrient pipeline. Then they blocked the switch with an experimental compound, shutting down the pipeline and, thereby, starving HIV to death. The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro. The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread. \"This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,\" said Harry Taylor, assistant professor in Medicine-Infectious Diseases. READ ALSO: First HIV self-test kit on sale in UK HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T-cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood. Activation increases the T-cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth. Until now, no one knew the first step that signalled a newly activated T-cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow. Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that the first step in stocking the T-cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline. This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth. READ ALSO: Antibody therapy manages to reduce 300-fold HIV\u2019s viral load The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found. Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV. The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients - even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines. \"Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,\" Taylor added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Pathogens. READ ALSO: New vaccine can improve HIV treatment"

The number of people getting married despite knowing they are HIV positive is even higher with the AIDS Society of India. Dr I.S Gilada, president of the society said, \"Those who are aware and know that HIV is manageable and allows for a good life expectancy through treatments do not fear about getting married.

Every year, more than 3,386 HIV-positive pregnant women in the state need anti-retroviral treatment to prevent their infants from acquiring the virus. In 2015, around 3,600 pregnant women were given the treatment. \u201cMother-to-child transmission is the most common way for children to get HIV infection. Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54% of the total HIV infected population in India. In most of these cases, the disease was transmitted through parents during birth,\u201c said infectious disease expert Milind Kulkarni. Today, it is possible to prevent perinatal HIV with effective and sustained use of medica tion. \u201cMost pe ople in India are unaware of this fact but an HIV posi tive mother can give birth to a disease-free child. A number of countries inclu ding Thailand have succeeded in completely eliminating this mode of transmission of HIVAIDS,\u201c said Kulkarni. He has extensively worked in various research projects of National AIDS Research Institute (NARI). Since HIV is transmitted through blood and blood-related products, transmission from an infected mother to her child can occur at any time during pregnancy. \u201cPutting infected expectant mothers on antiretroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is confirmed is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also given a six-week therapy to combat the threat.This protocol can successfully prevent mother-tochild transmission in most cases. Since breastfeeding can also transmit the HIV virus, infants born to infected mothers are recommended formula milk as a safe alternative to breast milk,\u201c he explained. Kulkarni said, \u201cIf an infected woman strictly follows HIV medication, and ensures her baby receives the required HIV medication for the initial six weeks, the risk of transmission reduces to less than five per cent.\u201c \u201cIn some cases, a caesarean section can help reduce risk of mother-to-child transmission during delivery,\u201c Kulkarni said. Infectious diseases expert Amit Dravid said, \u201cIndia can successfully eliminate mother-to-child transmission with sustained awareness initiatives and counselling to HIV-positive women.\u201c"

Even on the days we get back home, we usually end up taking enough rest before we start work again,\" said Captain Koustuv Goswami, pilot with Oman Air.

The NGO has written several letters to the officials at the Punjab state Aids Control Society, but in vain. On the non availability of the preventive medicines for HIV transmission in the new born, assistant project director, Punjab AIDS Control Society, Manpreet Chatwal, said, \"The medicine is not 100% preventive. There can be children who can turn positive from the infected mothers even after they are on these drugs. However, you come across such instances, please inform us. we will try and reach out to provide required medical aid.\" The apathy of the government towards the positives does not end here. The labour rooms in the government hospital in Amritsar has expired medicines stock, which have no potency to save the transmission. \"A couple of days ago, a baby girl contracted the virus, soon after her delivery, from her mother. The baby was given a medicine which was three days short of expiry. These preventive medicines which have expired are still kept in the labour room of Guru Nanak Dev government hospital, Amritsar,\" said Tarseem. To make the matters worse, Dry Blood Spot (DBS) analysis, a test which can detect the HIV status in the new born is also not available anywhere in Punjab. Accordingly the doctors start the new born HIV on ART drugs. \"Though the actual status of the new born is known after he or she is 18 months, delay in ART medicines after the DBS test can further enhance the virus,\" said a paediatrician in PGI."

        "body": "RAIPUR: Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in Chhattisgarh have run out of the crucial drug Nevirapine, used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, leaving many exposed to the risk of the deadly disease. According to officials, five ART centres that provide the drug free to HIV positive patients across the state have no stock of nevirapine syrup and tablets and some other medicines too could soon run out since no fresh stocks are coming in. Chhattisgarh Network for People Living with HIV said the shortage had exposed many to risks of the disease. Doctors revealed that pregnant women are supposed to receive a single dose of the drug at the time of labour and their newborn babies get a single dose of the drug syrup immediately after birth. \"Many babies in the state have missed this required dose, said president of Chhattisgarh Network of Positive People (CNPP), Rinki Arora. She said however, medicines- Tenofovir-lamivudine combination, which is prescribed to adults, and a lopinavir-ritonavir combination syrup that is given to children are available for next two months. However, they are apprehensive of yet another crises building up as it's already happened five times this year that stocks had run out. Talking to TOI, Rinki said she was in Delhi just to discuss the treatment strategy, as ART centres would soon be going out of stock of many medicines including tenofovir-lamivudine and lopinavir-ritonavir\". She said this is the big issue as drugs are necessary for the health of the mother and child. Secretary of CNPP, K Mukesh, said recently around 15 deliveries in Durg, 11 in Raipur and four in Bilaspur were conducted without the newborns being given the mandatory dose of nevirapine. He said the cost of one bottle is around Rs 1,200 and the dose is given according to weight but due to its cost, people don't buy it. He said that as per new guidelines of NACO, the drug is required to administer to newborns within six months. When contacted, additional project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, said there is shortage of nevirapine syrup but we can't do anything about it as only one company manufactures the same and there is no supply from it. According to officials, around 17,000 HIV patients including 2,500 children are registered at ART centres in the state."

        "title": "Chennai-Yale study pitches for universal HIV test to cut cost",
        "body": "LONDON: Testing every person in India\u2019s billion plus population for HIV will be cost effective, the first ever study on the benefit of universal HIV testing has found. A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic. The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One. Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus. According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization\u2019s standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country. In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone\u2019s life. They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195). The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others. Jessica Becker of Yale University said, \u201cWe were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.\u201d Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic. \u201cAs India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,\u201d she said."

The 7-year-old boy from Barasat was only a toddler when he lost his father to HIV/AIDS. His mother, also HIV-positive, begs for a living. HIV-affected Rahul was over the moon on Tuesday when he got new clothes for this year, thanks to nursing students and staff of the College of Nursing, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. \"Ami packet ta khule dekhbo ki dress acchhe? (May I open the packet to see what dress is in it?)\", asked Ria Mistry. The five-year-old lost her father to AIDS before she was born. Her mother succumbed to the disease two months ago. Since then, she has been living with her ailing grandparents in Basirhat. The students and staff of the nursing college distributed clothes to around 60 HIV-positive children. Most of these kids got the disease from their parents. A few of the thalassaemic children got infected during blood transfusion. \"Durga Puja is the time when people especially children love to flaunt their new clothes. Most of these children are orphans. Our students and staff have collected money to bring a smile on their faces. Such an interaction also helps us change the attitude of people towards HIV-positive patients,\" said S Das, a senior lecturer at the college. This is the second successive year the college has gifted clothes and other gifts to HIV-positive children under the 'Joy of Giving' campaign. For the students it was not just the joy of giving but an opportunity to interact with HIV patients. \"Even in the medical fraternity, awareness on HIV/AIDS is very low. An interaction with these patients helps remove the mental block. Spending time with them is an opportunity to learn and understand them better,\" said Apabrita Bandyopadhyay, a fourth-year nursing student. The college has tied up with North 24-Parganas Network for People living with HIV/AIDS (NNP+). West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society project director Utpal Bhattacharya, who was present at the function, lauded the students and teachers of the college for their gesture that touched the hearts of several kids. The principal of the medical college, Suddhadhan Batabyal, and the nursing college principal handed over the gifts to the kids. \"The gesture by the students and staff of the nursing college has touched us. These children are needy and they have none to shower them gifts. Giving them new clothes to wear during the festival means a lot to them,\" said Shukla Chakraborty, vice-president of NNP+.

        "title": "'A bionic ear for the elderly better than hearing aids'",
        "body": "NAGPUR: As more and more elderly population becomes socially active and independent, the world is trying to help them overcome the handicaps that accompany old age. Most of the western countries have started providing such elderly people with the option of cochlear implants, often referred to as a bionic ear. However, in India the procedure still remains largely associated with kids with congenital hearing problems. Vidarbha chapter of Geriatric Society of India (GSI) and city-based Neeti Cochlear Implant Trust wish to take the matter up by spreading awareness about the procedure among the elderly as well as the medical fraternity ahead of the world deafness day that falls on September 26. The society believes that this facility will help the older population even if the hearing aids fail to benefit them. \"In USA, most of the elderly people use the implants while in India they don't even know they have this option. As a person ages, the sensory hair cells in the inner ear that help one hear properly decrease in number. As most hearing aids only amplify sounds, many of these elderly people can hardly benefit from these aids. In such cases, a cochlear implant is a better option as it utilizes the existing inner hair cells, however less in number, to ensure that the sound waves reach the nerves connected to these cells,\" said senior ENT surgeon Dr Madan Kapre, who is also the secretary of Neeti Cochlear Implant Trust. Dr Kapre said he was always amazed by the fact that though the manuals and brochures about the implants had pictures of adults and even elderly, none of the Indian manufacturers he knew was making such implants for the elderly. \"In fact, it would be easier for the implants to be used for the geriatric population as unlike children they have their nerves and brains are used to the function of carrying and interpreting sound waves,\" he said. GSI secretary and preventive geriatrician Dr Sanjay Bajaj says that these implants can also improve the quality of life of the elderly, which is why the society is advocating their use. \"I know of a lot of my patients who are working professionally beyond the age of 60. Hearing impairment hampers not only their work but also social life. For the others, their family life gets affected and they may get isolated. The hearing aids come with their set of problems from having to charge batteries and removal and fixing of the aids again and again,\" he said. The financial and social independence and the increased level of physical fitness that the elderly people are enjoying these days should make it easier for them to avail of this facility, he added."

After volunteers shifted him to a centre run for such patients, he lay there shocked for days after realising his family, employers and relatives had all turned their backs on him. While Ismail is currently undergoing treatment, not-solucky Sarita died on the road unattended near the KPHB Metro station few weeks back. The 32-year old HIV patient was staying on the road with her four children after losing her husband to AIDS five months earlier. From earning Rs 11,000 per month between themselves and being able to provide shelter, food and schooling for their children, the family fell apart completely and started living on the streets. The children were later moved to an orphanage by an NGO. In yet another case a brother wasn\u2019t allowed to keep his HIV infected sister with him in a rented flat. He was forced to leave his sister at the state run Gandhi Hospital for over a month last year. Experts say more awareness on the disease is the only solution to the stigma. Discrimination looms large despite claims of the state health department about the stigma being on the decline. Activists say it may have worsened going by number of of HIV/ AIDS patients being abandoned by family members, dumped at hospitals, shown the door at the workplace and turned out from residential societies in the city."

The brand, known for its product quality and innovation, is the largest supplier of digital hearing aid devices in India. \u201cSince its launch in May 2013, the Dream family of advance hearing aids from the brand has set a new standard in hearing aid performance,\u201d said Shakeel H Rizvi. By increasing input range and maintaining the fidelity of all sounds entering the hearing aid, the product gives users a rich and detailed sound. Users say the product significantly helps improve speech perception among hearing aid users. A recent comparison test of high-end hearing aids showed that the product had the longest battery life when streaming. Added Bhupendra Chaudhary, \u201cThe new ultra-small Dream CIC (completely-in-canal) Micro is apt for hearing aid users, looking for a discreet solution that does not compromise on sound. Built on the successful True ISP platform, which is a proven performer, it provides outstanding sound quality, particularly in difficult listening situations. A recent study revealed that over 80% of users would prefer to wear a hearing aid that is small, discreet and almost invisible. With that in mind, we have developed this new product to look as invisible as possible. It is one of the smallest CIC models on the market \u2014 up to 30% smaller than our own current CIC hearing aids. However, the small size doesn\u2019t mean small sound. So, having difficulties hearing in noisy situations such as restaurants or at sporting events will become a thing of the past. The new product is easy to use, requiring no adjustment. After the fitting, you simply turn it on and forget that it is even there. If you\u2019re using hearing aids for the first time, then the special Personal Acclimatisation feature makes it easy to adapt to new sound. The product is available in four price points with different performance levels. Widex strives to find not just the right solutions but also the most natural solutions. This is reflected in our technology, design and environment, which form the basis of a natural choice campaign.\u201d"

        "body": "PATNA: Sneha (name changed), 21, was diagnosed with 'jaundice'. After three days of treatment, she lost consciousness and had to be admitted to a hospital, to be diagnosed with deadly 'hepatitis-B'. Her liver had developed cirrhosis and liver transplant was the only remedy. Her parents could hardly afford the costly transplant, and she died on seventh day in the hospital. According to WHO stats, two billion people worldwide have been infected with hepatitis-B virus and about 6 lakh people die every year as a result of hepatitis-B infection. In India, experts say, at least 5% people suffer from hepatitis-B. Hepatitis-B, or the inflammation of liver, is of two types. In the case of acute hepatitis-B, the person's immune system may get rid of it within a period of time. However, the patient is capable of transmitting it to other patients. 'Chronic' hepatitis-B may be a warrant to death if liver becomes cancerous and a liver transplant is not done, said PMCH's medicine HoD Dr J K L Das. The quirky fact about 'carrier' hepatitis is that it remains asymptomatic. \"You may live with it without knowing about it. Until and unless a hepatitis-B test is done or a serious liver ailment occurs, a patient may not come to know about it,\" gastroenterologist Dr BK Chaudhary said and added it might be too late by that time. Jaundice, loss of appetite, vomiting and nausea are common symptoms of hepatitis-B. If anybody is suffering from jaundice, the doctor must get him tested for hepatitis-B. It is also transmitted from mother to child. So doctors advise every pregnant woman to get a hepatitis-B test done. Hepatitis-B is a blood-borne disease. Like HIV, it gets transmitted through sexual intercourse, individual's blood/saliva or reused needles. Unlike hepatitis-A and E, it does not spread through contaminated food or water. Hepatitis-B, which is 50-100 times more infectious than HIV-AIDS, is preventable. \"If a proper vaccination course is given to someone, people develop immunity towards it,\" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. There is no age bar to get vaccinated. Normally, one dose of the vaccine costs Rs 200 at private hospitals. Doctors admit vaccination may not develop proper immunity. \"If the vaccine is not of good quality, it may not be of help. It is, therefore, better to get antibodies tested after taking the course of vaccines,\" said another doctor."

The share of women is crucial because of risk of transmission from pregnant women, uneducated and unaware women as well as among vulnerable groups including sex workers. The latest HIV estimates by the government show a 66% decline in new HIV cases in the last five years with an average of 86,000 new infections in 2015. The total number of those living with HIV is estimated at 21.17 lakh in 2015 compared with 22.26 lakh in 2007. While two-fifth of total HIV infections are among women, children under 15 accounted for 6.54% of the total cases. According to Nochiketa Mohanty, country programme manager, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, while there are programmes to prevent parent-to-child transmission of the virus, there is greater need to focus on women. \"There is a huge need to ramp up education and awarnessness about HIV infection among women besides upgrading the social status of women in order to empower her to make choices related to her sexual partner,\" he said. Experts also say HIV testing is not prevalent among women, especially in rural areas and even among the migrating population in both urban and rural settings. \"Women do not really go out and get tested for HIV because there is social stigma and taboo attached to it. They fear getting identified socially,\" Mohanty said.Over 40% living with HIV in India are women."

Reason: the residents welfare association has taken objection to their medical condition and ordered them to leave, with the alleged aid of local police. The apartment located in HUDA complex, Saroor Nagar is owned by a social worker, B S H Prasad and acts as a shelter for HIV positive people who are trying to lead a normal life. The home currently houses three students enrolled in leading professional colleges in the city and a lecturer of a private junior college in Guntur. According to the owner of the apartment, trouble started when the president of the residents welfare association, Srilatha, chanced upon posters on HIV awareness inside the apartment, where the four lived, around two weeks ago. She spread the word among the neighbours and in the enquiries which ensued, two of the four residents of the flat revealed their medical condition. Following this, the resident welfare association threatened the students and asked them to vacate. When they did not oblige, 16 of the 32 house owners of the residential complex gathered signatures complaining against their stay and approached the Saroor Nagar police station for help in evicting them. \"The police did not lodge any case but an SI, Naresh asked the four residents to leave the place. When they objected, he threatened them of dire consequences,\" said Prasad, activist and house owner, who has now moved the State Human Rights Commission against the residents welfare association. Responding to the issue, human rights and anti-stigma activists said that the residents welfare association of the complex and the police who allegedly threatened the HIV patients can be booked under the HIV AIDS Bill 2007. \"The right to privacy and right to lead a public and cultural life of all the four patients were denied in this case. Those responsible for publicising their medical condition and threatening them to vacate the place on the basis of their medical condition can be taken to court.

Meanwhile, Cyberabad police officials denied that any of their personnel threatened the inmates of the house. Police, however, admitted that a complaint had reached the Saroor Nagar police station from the residents association a fortnight ago. \"No action was taken. We advised them to solve the issue among themselves,\" a police official said. Activists, however, pointed out that the police could have taken action against the association. \"Instead of trying to solve the issue the police should have booked the residents welfare association as they were open about their bias,\" said M A Shakeel, coordinator, Human Rights Law Network."

Reason, an unofficial ban on tobacco products, especially gutka! In force for the past month, this ban has worked due to an informal initiative taken by the Panambur Beach Development Project, which is officially vested with the rights to develop the beach.The way this ban works is simple. All beachfront snack and general kiosks do not store or sell gutka. Tourists unaware of this ban but carrying gutka on them are frisked. Gutka found on them is confiscated, shredded in front of them and thrown into the waste bin. An initial experiment of returning confiscated gutka to owners while leaving the beach proved to be logistical nightmare for project authorities, who promptly shelved the idea.Interestingly, the beach of holidays and weekends sees an influx of visitors - local and outsiders in thousands. Yet the beach is clean from gutka stains. The success in this regard, notes Yathish Bykampady, CEO of the project is the \"100 per cent strike rate\" of project employees in spotting persons likely to carry gutka on them. \"Usually, they are from a lower economic strata, and majority of them are from North India,\" he infers.Since the ban is informal, even punishments for violations of the ban are informal yet effective, Yathish told TOI. A person who chews gutka and spits it on the pristine sand is promptly made to clean the mess in front of the other tourists, he says. Does this evoke protests from the errant tourists? No, says Yathish. In fact, they have been receptive to the idea behind the ban, that is to keep the beach clean for all tourists concerned, he adds.Another reason in enforcing this ban, Yathish observes is a simple question of would any one like to see their children play on the sands covered with gutka stains. Beaches that are not clean will not attract tourists, says Giridhar Kamath, an intrepid kite flyer who frequents the beach. This is one facility that provides outdoor recreation facility for thousands, and the least one can do is to keep the beach premises clean, he adds. jaideep.shenoy@timesgroup.com"

        "body": "Mention HIV/AIDS, and images of public hospitals, long queues of economically backward patients and government programmes to distribute free drugs come to mind. Rarely do middle-class people like Sumant, who has a small business and a bungalow in Bandra , crop up. The picture of middleclass or upper-crust patients is usually missing from India's HIV chapter. They share the same concerns about the disease as patients hailing from other social backgrounds , but their distress has an extra element: the feeling of being lost. \"The poor go to government hospitals where protocols are drawn up. A system seems in place,\" said Anita, an independent copywriter who got involved in HIV/AIDS care after her brother was diagnosed with the disease a couple of years ago. But for patients like her brother and Sumant, the problem begins right at the word go. \"Even getting a doctor specialising in HIV care in a reputed hospital is not easy,\" she said. There is the perennial worry about quacks or undertrained doctors. Worse, said Anita, patients feels shortchanged . \"How does a patient know that the private doctor he/she is going to is adequately trained in dispensing the potent antiretroviral drugs?\" asks Anita. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a cocktail of highly potent drugs that is given in various permutations and combinations. Doctors customise ART treatment depending on the patient's viral load report and immunity to a host of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or fungal/bacterial infections . In the last couple of years, pharmaceutical companies have brought out newer versions of ART. So, doctors can use first-line , second-line or third-line drugs (each subsequent version is more expensive ). \"How can a patient be sure that he or she is being prescribed a second-line drug because he/she needs it or because the doctor gets a bigger kickback from the manufacturing company,\" said Anita. The middle-class patient is too worried about stigma. Dr D G Saple, a senior dermatologist who was formerly associated with HIV care in the government-run JJ group of hospitals, said, \"Most middleclass patients are embarrassed to go to the chemist to buy medicines (for HIV/AIDS). So, they either prefer to take them from their doctors or contact the stockists directly.\" HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar said patients get the drugs cheaper when they take them from their doctors. \"There is a 40% price difference when a medicine is brought from the doctor . So, it is beneficial for the patients. Moreover, why should a patient not trust his doctor?\" In the case of a chronic disease, doctors and patients need to meet frequently . Dr Saple said many patients refuse to accept that they have HIV. \"It is difficult for them to accept this fact.\" Mumbai District AIDS Control Society chief Dr S S Kudalkar said private patients could always drop by at public hospitals if they need a second opinion. \"But private patients don't want to go to public hospitals and be seen waiting in queues meant for HIV+ people,\" Dr Saple said. Dr Maniar pointed out that a patient who can afford thirdline drugs-costing Rs 18,000 a month-would be wise enough to know whether he or she could trust the doctor."

But as he awaits discharge from Jaslok Hospital, his positive feelings are tinged with bitterness. Although his mother, Kamala (name changed) donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son in operations held on February 1, the family had to wait for seven months to complete the paperwork needed for the transplant. \"I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. We went back and forth several times in this period to get the paperwork done,'' he said. The delay was caused mainly due to the stringent transplant rules. \"Here, a mother has given a kidney to her son. As per the transplant Act, this is a familial transplant and doesn't require any no-objection certificate,'' said Dr Rushi Deshpande, who is Singh's nephrologist. But Maharashtra government rules require an NOC even in case of families when the donor is from outside the state. In fact, the matter is being heard by the Bombay high court following a petition filed by a nephrologist protesting against this rule. \"The hospital had told us five months back that my husband is healthy enough to undergo a transplant, but the paperwork delayed us immensely,'' said Singh's wife. She was particularly worried about his counts falling due to his HIV status. \"Even though his HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar managed to keep his counts well, it was difficult for us to find a hospital that was willing to conduct his dialysis. We were charged extra for each session because of his condition,'' she added. On February 1, after 17 days of preparation and a seven-month wait, the operation was carried out. \"The most difficult aspect of a transplant for an HIV-positive patient is the tightrope walk between avoiding rejection and complex infections (due to HIV). So it took us 17 days to work out the right combination for Singh,'' said Dr Deshpande, adding that Singh would be discharged on Wednesday with a normal kidney function showing serum creatnine of 1. Singh is the third HIV-positive patient to get a kidney in Mumbai. When contacted, a senior government official said the government was, on directions from the high court, reworking the NoC clause."

        "body": "KANPUR: In wake of increasing cases of discrimination to People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLHA) reported in different districts of the state, the health and family welfare department has decided to take stern action against the doctors, nurses and health workers for the denial of the services to the positive patients. In defiance of the services being provided to PLHA under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, any verbal or written complaint can likely lead to severe punishment to the hospital staff in both government and private sector hospitals. In an official letter issued by the principal secretary, Pradeep Shukla to all the chief medical officer and principal of the medical colleges of the state, attention has been drawn towards directives to enhance the extent and efficacy of the treatment administered to PLHA's. Mentioning that many times, cases are reported where medical staff in rural areas refuse to provide treatment to the HIV patients after they are detected HIV positive, the chief medical officer Dr Ashok Mishra informed that for the comprehensive care of PLHA's at ART centre, all doctors, nurses and hospital staff, whether in public sector or in private sector should treat PLHA's in a professional and humane manner, always with dignity and care. \"No doctors and nurses shall refuse to treat a PLHA on account of his/her positive status. In treating a PLHA, there shall be no discrimination or stigma whatsoever,\" he said. Giving an instance, CMO said, \"doctors and nurses create stigma at the time of the delivery of an HIV positive pregnant females especially in the rural areas. Thus, keeping in view of such practices, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has a provision of post exposure prophylaxis wherein any doctor or paramedical staff getting in contact with the blood or other fluid of an HIV patient, will be provided anti retro viral medicine free of cost for the sake of safety.\" But it is the irony that many a times PLHA's are not being treated in humane manner, instead they are discriminated from the treatment as well as society. Thus, to make the doctors and ART centres aware of their responsibilities, an attempt has been initiated to provide better health care facilities to the diseased. Besides, government hospitals, directives have been issued to doctors in the private sectors to get themselves familiarise with the NACO's comprehensive protocol and policies with regard to care and treatment. \"Generally there are private practitioners who take advantage of the illiteracy and poverty of those suffering with HIV/AIDS by prescribing wrong or unnecessary regimes of drugs or charge an exorbitant amount,\" said deputy chief medical officer, Dr Rajesh Jha. \"Such practices can be tackled only with the help of health associations like Indian Medical Association, Surgeons of India, Indian Academy of Paediatrics and others,\" he said. \"Strict actions has to be taken against the irrational prescription of ART. While all the advertisements offering potential cure for HIV must be banned and such organisations must be dealt strictly, as there is no proven cure available for HIV/AIDS,\" he added."

The rate of positivity oscillated between 10-13% from 1996 to 2001 but came down to 1.7% in 2012. The decrease in HIV cases has been significant since 2008, in which year the rate of positivity dropped to 6.10% and in the subsequent year it dropped to 4.25%. As per the last count, in April 2013, 168 new cases were detected as against 1,000-900 new cases registered every year about a decade ago. Dr Sachin Govenkar, project director, Goa State Aids Control society (GSACs), said better surveillance, awareness programmes and interventions, have helped curb HIV in the state. The drop in number of HIV cases is significant because the number of blood samples tested during the last five years is far higher than between 2003 and 2008. Since 2009 onwards, the number of blood samples tested crossed the 30,000-mark, whereas during the preceding years' blood samples tested varied between 14,000 and 25,000 a year. In 2012 itself, 44,553 blood samples were tested and 532 new cases were detected during that period. \"Intensified awareness programmes carried out by the GSACs for over a decade in co-ordination with NGOs have proved effective in curtailing the number of cases,\" a GSACs official said. There have been no other changes observed in the detection pattern of HIV infections. Four major coastal talukas -- Tiswadi, Bardez, Salcete and Mormugao continue to have a high rate of HIV prevalence. Also, 80-85% of the total HIV cases belong in the age group of 15-49 years, and sexual transmission is the predominant mode of contraction. Antiretroviral therapy started in Goa Medical College (GMC) & Hospital, Bambolim, in 2005 has been a great solace to HIV/AIDS patients. AIDS patients with CD 4 count less than 200 are provided free antiretroviral treatment."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Nearly two out of every five female sex workers (FSWs) in India could be suffering from HIV infection. Those who aren\u2019t already infected, however, carry more than 50-times increased risk of getting infected during their lifetime. The region where the risk of HIV infection increased most for a sex worker was Asia (29 times more) compared to a 12-time higher threat in Africa and Latin America. A study, conducted by Dr Stefan Baral from the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg School of Public Health, to be published by the Lancet on Thursday shows that FSWs in developing countries are 14 times more likely to be infected by HIV than women in the general population. The authors carried out an analysis of 102 studies, representing almost 100,000 FSWs in 50 countries. Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%. In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population. \u201cWe identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,\u201d the authors said. \u201cThese findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,\u201d they added. \u201cWhen reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,\u201d is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India. In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National Aids Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive. The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000. While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections. The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don\u2019t even know their HIV status. The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection \u2013 notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men \u2013 is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years."

        "body": "MELBOURNE: Cow's milk can be potentially developed into affordable creams that can help protect humans against HIV, a study has claimed. Lead scientist from University of Melbourne Marit Kramski found that when pregnant cows were vaccinated with an HIV protein, the first milk produced by the cow after giving birth, called colostrum, produced high antibodies to protect its newborn against disease. Researchers were now planning to test the effectiveness and safety of the milk before turning it into a cream which will hopefully allow women to protect themselves against contracting the virus during sex, without relying on men, the Herald Sun reported. However, the final result could be a decade off. The researchers were able to inhibit the virus from infecting cells when combing the virus cells with milk. \"We think the antibodies bind to the surface of the virus and blocks the protein which needs to be freed to get in contact with human cells - like a key and lock system. If the key's not accessible or you change the key, you can't open the door,\" Kramski said adding \"It's a very cheap and easy way to produce a lot of antibodies.\" Kramski had partnered with Australian biotechnology company Immuron Ltd to develop the milk, and would continue working with them to produce a preventative cream. \"We have the antibodies at the moment - the next step will be formulation,\" Kramski said. Condoms were \"cheap and easy\" but not an option for everyone with millions of people getting infected with HIV every year, she added. \"A lot of women, especially in Africa or South America they don't have the power to say you need to use a condom before we have sex. \"This milk looks like it can be a cheap, easy new prevention tool, because if you use drugs it's really expensive,\" she said."

        "body": "J J Hospital's gynaecology department has scored a perfect 100 in one of its most trying tasks: delivering 100 HIV-free babies of HIV-positive mothers since March 2014. The hospital, considered a referral centre for HIV-positive pregnant women who are turned away from other hospitals, has performed deliveries of 1,200 HIV-positive women since 2000. \u201cWe have been working on reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV since 2000. But we have been pleasantly surprised to note that 100 children born since the start of the three-drug regimen (Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz) are HIV-free,\u201c said Dr Rekha Daver, who heads JJ Hospital's gynaecology department and is on the National AIDS Control Organisation task force. Without drug intervention, such children have 45% risk of HIV infection during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The last 100 deliveries of HIV-positive mothers at the state-run J J Hospital in Mumbai have been more special for two reasons. Firstly, these HIV-positive pregnant women got special treatment due to the Union ministry of health's decision to start them on an anti-HIV regimen for life as soon they discovered their pregnancy. Secondly, the children don't carry the dreaded virus. Between 2001 and 2002, India started giving a single dose (of Nevirapine tablet) to pregnant women and the newborn. \u201cThis helped cut down the transmission risk to a great extent, but the mothers risked developing drug resistance later on,\u201c said Dr Daver. Moreover, 7% of the children born to HIV-positive mothers in J J Hospital contracted the virus under the Nevirapine regimen; the national average was higher at 11%. In 2014, India accepted the World Health Organisation's Option B+ that entails pregnant women taking the three drug dose daily to reduce the viral load in their bodies. \u201cTo ensure women take the drugs daily, the government has worked out a single tablet of these three drugs to be taken before sleeping every night,\u201c said Dr Daver. As a result, the viral load among the mothers fell to negligible levels. \u201cMoreover, women can breast-feed their child without the fear of transmitting the virus (there is a 8-25% chance of the child getting infected by breastfeeding),\u201c she added. There is, however, a spot of big worry. \u201cWe estimate that 36,000 HIV-positive women get pregnant every year, but barely 14,000 women make it to antenatal centres and get medicines and help. We are worried about this missing mothers,\u201c Dr Srikala Acharya, who heads the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society, said."

In one way, the government hospitals are far better compared to the open discrimination practiced by corporate hospitals in such cases,\u201d said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president, NGO Helping Hand Foundation. However, in its notice, the NHRC sought explanation why instead of initiating treatment of the patient, \u2018they made them run from one hospital to the other\u2019. Meanwhile, the 14-year-old boy is awaiting an appointment with gastroenterologist and a neurologist at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) before the state run Chest hospital\u2019s Antiretroviral Therapy(ART) centre can start his treatment with drugs. More than ART drugs, the boy seems to be in immediate need of hospitalisation, requiring expert help from a multi-disciplinary team of doctors as he has been diagnosed with HIV induced dementia, according to the discharge report written by NIMS hospital doctors on Monday. \u201cHe is critically ill and may not survive unless he gets immediate attention ,\u201dadded Mustaba Hasan."

        "title": "Toe-reading astrologer works to make future of HIV-infected kids better",
        "body": "Predicting the future and looking into the past by reading the lines on one's big toe may at best be called debatable. But the money an astrologer earns from this unique practice undoubtedly serves a good social cause. With the income he makes, astrologer Vijay supports at least 30 HIV-infected children in his village in Erode district. Astrology's purpose, according to Vijay, is to interpret the positions of the planets and stars in the sky to gather information on an individual. But in his social life, it goes beyond that. Vijay learnt the art after studying in detail the lines and patterns on one's big toe. For him, it all began at the age of 18. Today, he has read the lines on more than 4,500 big toes of people from different walks of life. Solutions may vary, but it's his devotion for this rare field of astrology that still brings people to his village called Avalpunthurai, 12 km from Erode. As a child, Vijay was different from his friends. Besides being a staunch devotee of lord Shiva, he was fond of dogs, considered the vahana (vehicle) of the lord. To express his devotion towards dogs, he even ran a shelter for dogs in his village. \"I was a devotee of Shiva from my childhood. When I grew up, I used to dream of the lord. It was in one such dream that I got the idea of toe-reading,\" said Vijay, who was in Chennai recently. Vijay takes the print of one's big toe and studies the various lines on it. \"It takes four to five hours in some cases, but I could give solutions to most people who have approached me so far,\" he said. But learning to read the lines on one's big toe was not easy as Vijay didn't have any basic training on astrology. When he turned 18, Vijay started studying toe-prints of people and conducted research on how they are related to one's past and present. Vijay first started taking the toe-prints of some drunkards in his village. He then started analyzing the lines on the big toes of people who are suffering from health problems. It took a couple of years for him to understand the difference between the lines found on toes of people suffering from various issues. \"People in my village thought I was mad. And my strong faith in lord Shiva was another reason for them to feel so. But I didn't look back. I studied the toe-prints of more than 1,000 people during my research. It was after getting a clear understanding about the subject, I began reading the big toes of people and started giving solutions to their problems,\" said 38-year-old Vijay. What makes Vijay truly different, however, is the noble act that he does for the HIV-infected children in his village. \"I am not doing toe-reading for money. I am doing this under the instruction from my god. The money is used for the welfare of some 30 HIV-infected children in my village,\" he said. Besides, the Sri Bhairava Foundation, under his chairmanship, has contributed to a number of heart operations, particularly for children, conducted in and around Erode."

But, for all those who chose life, the going hasn\u2019t been any easy, says Mahesh, an HIV+ for 11 years now. \u201cIn 2005, I found out I was HIV + at a blood donation camp. I worked for a private firm and was a bachelor then. It felt my world collapsed that moment and from then on, I would just stay in my room, moping over my condition,\u201d he said. Then a friend suggested a visit to Uttar Pradesh Network for people with HIV + & AIDS (UPNP). Mahesh says he felt like he was reborn then. \u201cI married an HIV+ girl in 2011 and how our lives changed! HIV + is not the end of the road but the beginning of a new journey,\u201d says Mahesh. Like Mahesh, there many with HIV+ people who have overcome odds to lead a productive life. When Fatima (35) found out she was HIV+ in 2004, she locked herself inside her room for five days. \u201cMy sister-in-law used to curse me daily... I could hear her even from inside my room. I just wanted to die. Then a TV series gave me hope.\u201d Fatima visited a counselling centre which led her to UPNP. \u201cI got married three years ago and my husband is supportive. We have decided to create awareness about HIV virus. It is not an illness and proper prevention can help the infected person feel better,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thrown out of my job. My colleagues laughed at me, even my own family disowned me,\u201d says 40-year-old Suresh who was diagnosed in 2001. One night, while eating at a dhaba, he met a man who was also an HIV + and life changed thereafter. \u201cHIV+ just requires you to take preventive measures and you can lead a healthy life,\u201d he said. \u201cI have got a good job and have emerged a winner,\u201d he said. UPNP chief Naresh Yadav said HIV+ people were not criminals. It\u2019s just that they were prone to catching infections as the virus weakens their immune system. Dr Himanshu, head of anti-retroviral (ART) therapy centre at KGMU for HIV+, said HIV never spreads by one\u2019s saliva, sweat or urine. It is only transmitted if the blood of the infected person comes in contact with a body. Then, he said, precaution can be taken within 72 hours, known as Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), under which certain medicines reduce the exposure of the virus. He said HIV+ couples can have kids through Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT). There have been over 50 cases where children were born to couples with HIV virus, he said.

Comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS among women in the age bracket of 15-49 remains minimal. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (2015-16) report released last year, only 9.4% of women in the specified age bracket had comprehensive knowledge about the disease. Assam cuts a sorry figure when compared to its sisters in the region: Mizoram (66.4%), Meghalaya (13.3%), Nagaland (12.2%), Sikkim (25.5%), Tripura (28%) and Manipur (40.7%). The state will follow the rest of the world in celebrating International Women's Day on Wednesday but factors like ignorance, gender inequality, minimal awareness on contraceptives and usage of safety methods have rendered a section of women here vulnerable to AIDS/HIV. As on October 31 last year, 1,012 pregnant women were detected with HIV out of the 17,08,918 women who were tested at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre. In 2015 (up to September 30) 867 pregnant women were found to be HIV positive out of 13,76,766. The year before, 769 pregnant women were found to be HIV positive out of 11,95,412. \"Few women here know that using a condom can reduce the chances of getting HIV/AIDS. Awareness needs to be inclusive,\" said SI Ahmed, one of the first medical practitioners in the state to study AIDS in the region. HIV positive women continue to face difficulties in getting property rights, facing social stigma and being denied housing facilities."

Authorities at Goa Medical College and Hospital's anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre have drawn a blank as to the source of infection as none of the children have had any blood transfusion. Sources suspect the children may have fallen prey to sexual exploitation. A counselor who handled the case of a girl whose HIV status was established at the age of nine, said sessions with the girl and her parents were inconclusive as to the source of infection. Both parents tested negative for HIV. \"The mother told me she never left her daughter in the company of strangers. The girl has now turned 13 and is taking ART treatment,\" the counselor said. The counselor was also not able to get any information from the girl on any sexual exposure. In two other similar cases, parents were found to be negative. One of the boys was raped by a person who was HIV positive. \"It was a medico-legal case and it was established that boy had been raped,\" the counselor said. In the other case of any infected male child counselors reached a dead end as neither are parents infected nor did medical history reveal any blood transfusion. \"We suspect he must have been sexually exploited as we don't see any other way how he could have got the infection at this young age,\" the counselor said. A few months back another case was referred to the ART counselor wherein a 13 year-old-girl was raped by a HIV infected person. Though her first test was negative, her status will be known only after the window the period is over. Presently, over 200 HIV positive children who were infected a birth by their parents are receiving ART in GMC's ART centre. Senior medical officer Dr Vanda Viegas told TOI doctors have to encourage parents to ensure that the children are brought for treatment on time. \"The tendency is to wait till the child falls really ill. Children are more vulnerable to opportunistic infections,\" Viegas said. ART consists of a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs that help to significantly restrain the HIV virus and stop its progression."

        "body": "CHANDIGARH: A year after Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched on October 2, Punjab's cities may have got dismal rankings in the cleanliness survey, but people in the state seem to be buying more cleanliness aids for their homes. However, there are divergent views on whether this is due to the campaign or growing hygiene levels. Demand analysis for the past few months conducted by Pranay Impex, a domestic manufacturer of household cleaning aids in 17 cities, claims that the demand for cleaning product sale have risen by 30% in Punjab since the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, thereby hinting that the problem lies with the local bodies that have failed in keeping the surroundings clean. \"People of Punjab are spending substantially in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene of their houses. The demand for brooms, toilet brushes and scrubbers are on a constant rise even in the interiors of Punjab. Demand for these products has almost doubled in the last 1 year,\" said Praveen Khandelwal, director of Pranay Impex. \"People of the state are buying more scrubbers, brooms and toilet brushes and it is the local bodies that have failed in their duty to keep the cities clean. People of Punjab are spending substantially in maintaining the cleanliness and hygiene in their houses,\" he added. However, Sushil Jain of Roop Enterprises, which deals in cleaning liquids in Punjab, said the sector itself is growing and it may not necessarily due to the campaign. \"Due to general awareness about hygiene and increasing paying capacity of people, there has been year-on-year growth,\" he insisted. Even though companies like Reckitt India have promised to spend Rs 100 crore in the next five years for creating awareness about the importance of hygiene and sanitation, reaching out to 2,000 villages in a year, local traders rue that there haven't been any steps to incentivize use of cleanliness products. As many as seven of the 17 cities in Punjab are ranked at the bottom 100 of the 476 cities in the country in the cleanliness survey under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and Hoshiarpur is the dirtiest (447) of these, followed by Malerkotla (431) and Barnala (439). The other four are Amritsar (430), Abohar (420), Muktsar (384) and Ludhiana (381).

        "body": "CHENNAI: While there has been an overall decline in the prevalence of HIV infection in Tamil Nadu, the prevalence of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) are on the rise. This is demonstrated not only by the latest figures of the National Aids Control Organisation which show the prevalence in Tamil Nadu dropping from 0.5% in 2003 to 0.25% in 2007 in the case of general population and rising from 4% to 7% in the case of MSM but also by the findings of a survey conducted by Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCARE). The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected. \"The sustained campaign by the government about the use of condoms and its various awareness programmes for sex workers (the prevalence of HIV among them decreased from 9% in 2003 to 4.7% in 2007) and truck drivers have clearly shown results. But things remain unchanged as far as MSM and drug users are concerned,\" says Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, senior medical officer and epidemiologist at YRGCARE, who presented the data at the 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Montreal last year. \"MSM remain a hidden population in India primarily due to Section 377 of the IPC, which has historically criminalised sex between men, and also the societal and family pressures to marry. Hence, there is very little community-level data of HIV among MSM. So we used a technique called peer-driven recruitment, which uses MSM to recruit other MSM to arrive at the study sample,\" says Dr Solomon. The study also documented the existence of HIV epidemics among MSM in many smaller cities such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, which are usually not included in the planning of interventions targeted at MSM. Also, more interesting was the finding that the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among MSM who were married is double compared to MSM who were not married. \"About 35% of our sample of MSM were married. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among MSM who were married could partially be explained by their nature to keep their same sex practices even more hidden. Consequently, they ended up having more male partners, which has been shown by many studies to be a strong risk factor for HIV infection,\" explains Dr Solomon. Sahodaran, an organisation that works with MSM, conducted a similary survey recently in association with the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chetpet and found that 8% of MSM in Chennai were HIV infected. But Sunil Menon, who runs Sahodaran, says there is no tangible evidence to back such figures because the gay community still remains hidden. \"Maybe the figure is shown rising just because more people are testing now than they did before. So there is no way of saying whether the prevalence is increasing, decreasing or remains the same,\" says Menon. Says Dr Solomon, \"The current phase of the National AIDS Control Programme has initiatives targeting MSM. Only time will tell the effectiveness of these programmes but the government needs to be applauded for the fact that it recognizes HIV among MSM as an issue and is taking steps to address it. However, it is equally important to address issues related to the families (wives and children) of these marginalised populations who are also being placed at risk via their spouses' behaviors.\""

The announcement is a boost for a generation of Thai health workers who have transformed the nation from one of Asia's most HIV-ravaged societies to a pin-up for how to effectively tackle the crisis. Describing the elimination as a \"remarkable achievement\", the WHO said Thailand was \"the first (country) with a large HIV epidemic to ensure an AIDS-free generation\". Belarus and Armenia were also declared free of mother-to-baby HIV transmissions on Wednesday, but both nations have a much lower prevalence of the virus. Previously, Cuba was the only other country to have eliminated mother-to-child transmission under the WHO's criteria -mother-to-child transmission rates of less than 2% and fewer than 50 new infections in 100,000 births -back in July last year. The global health body said Thailand's routine screening and universal free medication for pregnant women with HIV was crucial in stopping the virus being passed to new generations. If left untreated, mothers with HIV have a 15-45% chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, childbirth or while breastfeeding. But taking antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy significantly reduces those chances to just over 1%. In 2000, Thailand became one of the first countries in the world to provide free antiretroviral medication to all pregnant women diagnosed with HIV. Screening for the virus during pregnancy is also routine, even in the country's most remote areas, the WHO added. According to Thai government figures, the number of babies born with HIV has dropped from 1,000 in 2000 to just 85 last year, a large enough fall for the WHO to declare mother-to-child transmission over. It is a major turnaround for Thailand. The country went from 100,000 HIV cases in 1990 to over a million three years later, fuelled in part by its huge sex trade. Health workers initially struggled to persuade governments to act."

The woman had been thrown out of two state-run hospitals even after suffering serious injuries in a road accident. Debashis Roy, the chief medical officer (health), Howrah, set up a three-member committee to probe the allegations and informed that all expenses for the woman\u2019s treatment will be borne by the district administration. Babita Dolui (name changed) fractured her right arm and cracked her spine in a road accident on November 8. When she was taken to Howrah District Hospital, doctors and nurses turned her away when her husband reportedly said she was HIV-positive. The Calcutta Medical College Hospital also refused Babita. She was admitted to the Howrah hospital on November 18, but had to spend the night on the floor next to a corpse beside the toilet. Since then, Babita was at home. When Roy was contacted by TOI on Tuesday, he said Babita would be admitted to the Howrah hospital on Wednesday. Around 4.45pm, she was wheeled into the female surgical ward with the dignity that all patients deserve, notwithstanding whether they are HIV-positive or not. In the morning, the CMOH called up Babita\u2019s family and asked them to take her to the hospital. Neighbours then fetched an ambulance. \u201cIt was a shameful incident.

A three-member committee comprising deputy CMOH-I Ranjit Das, Howrah District Hospital superintendent Narayan Chatterjee and nursing superintendent Manisha Ghosh has been set up to probe the incident. The committee will submit its report in two days. Tests will be carried out to ascertain whether the woman is HIV-positive. Her mother claims that she has no knowledge of this. I wonder on what basis the doctors mentioned this on her prescription,\u201d the CMOH said. Bablu Adak, a neighbour, said that they will stand by Babita. \u201cWe will ensure she doesn\u2019t suffer.

Particularly because it was a reversal of its own conscious and bold decision taken only a few days ago to admit those students on \"humanitarian grounds\". When the Salesian priests came to Sulcorna over 50 years ago, they transformed large swathes of jungle areas into a farm, growing sugarcane, cashew, and other cash crops, employing locals as farmhands and helping the needy. Today the Don Bosco Agro-Ed Complex at Sulcorna, situated on a sprawling lush land, has grown into a hub of educational, agricultural and social activities. \"Besides playing a pioneering role in the remote villages along this hinterland belt in the field of agriculture, horticulture, watershed development etc, the activities of Don Bosco Sulcorna, have always been village-centric. We have taken utmost care of the villagers all these years and the locals hold us in high esteem. We are always the first to reach out to them in their times of need. We have always fought for protecting the interests of the villagers. We have helped them form self-help groups and cooperative societies, besides helping the young in gaining employment. Though our students come from a poor background, they excel in studies and are on par with those from the urban schools. Our relationship with the villagers is close knit and we share a mutual trust,\" sources in the school management told TOI. Sources within the local community confirmed that it was exactly because of the villagers' sense of attachment and belonging to Don Bosco school that they felt \"let down\" by the school management when it granted admission to HIV positive students residing \"far away\" from the village. The school management is now concerned about the probable withdrawal of students by their parents in case admission is granted to the HIV positive students. The HIV positive students have also been denied admission in at least two other schools located in the vicinity of the children's home in which they are lodged, it is reliably learnt. It was exactly because of such discrimination against HIV positive students that the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, an organization which runs a care home for orphaned and vulnerable children, had moved the Supreme Court, invoking the fundamental rights to life, education and equality guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. The foundation had pointed out that based on their own HIV status or that of their parents or guardians, children affected by HIV face multiple forms of discrimination in schools. It was on this PIL that on March 3, the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and all states to declare HIV positive children as a disadvantaged group under the Right to Education (RTE) Act to ensure they got education without discrimination. Section 9(c) of the Act says, \"Every local authority shall ensure that the child belonging to weaker section and the child belonging to disadvantaged group are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds.\""

        "title": "No ready answers to cut HIV infections through blood transfusions",
        "body": "AHMEDABAD: Gujarat recorded the country's highest number - 1,658 cases - of transfusion transmitted HIV infections from 2010-11 to 2014-15, says the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). This has raised a serious question about the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients in the state. For many - like the parents of 30-odd thalassaemic children who suffered a double whammy when they got HIV infections after regular transfusions - the figures are a chilling reality. Experts point out that a wide range of factors, including medical negligence, three-month window period of the HIV virus where the virus is not diagnosed by the ELISA test, failed testing mechanisms in public health and wrong information provided by patients, contribute to the high figures of HIV spread through transfusion. \"In the past, complaints of instances of sample pooling for HIV testing have been raised which compromises test results. Since pooling of samples dilutes the viral load of a positive sample, many times it does not get detected and is passed on to a patient,\" a senior microbiologist in Ahmedabad told TOI. The CBI, in its report in the Junagadh case, has said that there was negligence in testing of blood samples and recommended stringent compliance by blood banks. It however did not have evidence to prove a criminal offence. J P Gupta, health commissioner and project director of Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says there is no foolproof testing method to completely eliminate the HIV virus - which has a three-month window when it is not picked by regular testing - from the public health delivery domain. A petition was moved in the high court for use of the more advanced PCR testing instead of ELISA. The court however said that the issue was better left to experts when it was furnished in court that using the expensive PCR testing can prove detrimental in a public health scenario, and make blood unaffordable to a majority if mandated. Dr Rajendra Gadhvi, joint director GSACS, says Gujarat is the highest voluntary blood donating state - an average of 7-9 lakh blood units are donated annually. He says the figure of 1,685 cases through blood transfusion is arrived at from case histories recorded by patients. \"In India, where sex is still taboo, many patients give an incorrect history to save themselves embarrassment. In many cases, people record transfusion as the cause instead of unsafe sex.\""

        "title": "62% jump in HIV/AIDS deaths in Mumbai in 1 year: Health ministry",
        "body": "MUMBAI: Deaths due to AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) have increased significantly in the city over the last three years, according to data available with the central health ministry\u2019s Health Management Information System. While 27 HIV-positive people died in Mumbai in 2015-16, the number rose to 72 in 2016-17 and further to 116 in 2017-18, showed the data. \u201cThere has been a 62% increase in deaths due to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in the last one year alone,\u201d said RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who compiled the data. Between 2015 and 2016, the deaths rose by 166%. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, that had peaked in the nineties, has become manageable due to availability of medicines called antiretroviral treatment (ART); a fatal disease was soon transformed into achronic condition manageable with drugs. Number of deaths fell as a result even as the number of fresh HIV infections began to show a decline in the last few years. In this backdrop, the sudden spurt in deaths is worrisome, said doctors. A senior doctor, who didn\u2019t want to be identified, said, \u201cDeaths occur in poor patients in whom the current mode of treatment has failed.\u201d Patients for whom the first line of ART no longer worked due to years of use, needed second- or third-line drugs. \u201cHowever, these new medicines are expensive and not easily available in the governmentrun programme. The poor cannot afford to buy them,\u201d the doctor added. However, city authorities in charge of the HIV/AIDS control programme said there is a simple explanation for the increase: A sharper public health programme that has managed to track more patients. Dr Shrikala Acharya of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) said the organization had carried out intensive loss-to-follow-up drives as per central government directives to track patients who were lost to follow-up. \u201cThis drive helped us update the actual number of deaths. It could also be the reason for the increase in reported deaths,\u201d she said, adding that the rise isn\u2019t necessarily an actual increase in the number of deaths. Incidentally, the HMIS data shows that the number of AIDS deaths has been steadily decreasing across Maharashtra. From 1,426 deaths in 2015-16, the figure fell to 1,390 in the following year and further to 1,327 in 2017-18. A doctor said that HIV care has improved so much that very few deaths are recorded in the private sector, where patients pay for the latest medicine and get updated care."

        "body": "Mumbai: Young people in Maharashtra aged 18-35 accounted for a substantial number of new HIV infections in 2014-15. Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch. An analysis by the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it. Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above. Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. \u201cThere is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,\u201d he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale. The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, \u201cThe disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved.\u201d Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex. But an expert said, \u201cThe cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition.\u201d The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO)."

First, CD-4 lab was organized at microbiology department by principal and dean GSVM College Anand. Later, Red Ribbon symbol was displayed in form of human chain on the grounds of GSVM. A flag march was taken out on the occasion from the department in which senior and junior doctors, students, staff, nurses and general public participated. They all held banners to create awareness about HIV and AIDS. A nukkad natak was staged in the seminar hall and out-patient department (OPD) complex, through which message was given to general public on how HIV spread and by what means it could be controlled. At seminar hall, a welcome address was given by Prof Navneet Kumar (director and HOD, medicine). He said HIV/AIDS had been largely misinterpreted by the society. Practically the disease was 99% preventable but still it had affected 38.2 million people worldwide. In India, around 3.5 million people were HIV+. He also talked about the theme of World AIDS Day 2011- 'Getting Zero-Zero AIDS Related Death'. Dr Anand Swarup threw light on the treatment aspects of HIV/AIDS at ART Centre, Kanpur and also told how CD-4 machine was beneficial for patients. Dr BP Priyadarshi (assistant professor, dept of medicine and nodal officer of ART Centre) talked about epidemiology of HIV/AIDS ART centre Kanpur and other aspects related to HIV/AIDS. Dr Rahul Mishra gave a presentation on latest guideline about management of HIV and opportunistic infection. Dr Chaman Kumar (senior medical officer, ART Centre) gave presentation on universal precautions. Expressing her concern on HIV/AIDS, Prof Arti Lal Chandani said the centre would be able to cater to the needs of a large chunk of the affected population."

Thanks to the activities of the health department, there was a 57 per cent drop in the number of AIDS cases in the state during the last 10 years. In the past year, the spread of HIV from mother to child had been reduced to just two, he said. Free treatment at hospitals and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres helped in controlling spread of AIDS. Presently, there were 27,173 HIV patients in the state, he said. The benefits for them would be increased and awareness strengthened, he said. The meeting was informed that the children of HIV patients will be included in the social security mission 'Sneha Poorvam' scheme and they would be given financial help ranging between Rs 350-to Rs 1,000 every month as educational scholarship.

The woman from Karnataka, in her 40s, came to know about the HIV infection only after tests were conducted by the hospital during delivery. When the hospital checked the blood samples of her husband, he too was found to be HIV positive. It is too early to identify if their child, who is just 13-days old, has contracted the infection. Both husband and wife work here as labourers. The incident came to the attention of women\u2019s commission member Shahida Kamal after some activists informed her about the incident. \u201cOn World AIDS Day, I had said that the commission would take up cases of destitute HIV positive patients.

        "body": "PONDA: Even as the state maintained its trend of an overall drop in the number of HIV cases for the fourth year in a row, the southernmost taluka, Canacona, has recorded a disturbing rise. Statistics of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) show 14 persons contracted the virus up to October this year as against four persons in the corresponding period last year; a rise of over 300%. The state's apex body for control of HIV/AIDS in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials. The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines. Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr Rajananda Desai said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus. Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11). Dips were also seen in Bicholim (14; down four from last year's 18), Sanguem (12; down four from 16) and Sattari (14; down one from 15). GSACS' statistics also show an increase in the number of those who succumbed to full-blown AIDS this year. Eighty-one persons-57 men, 23 women and a transgender person-succumbed to AIDS between January and September 2012 as against 90 who died between January and December 2011. Commenting on this, Desai said, \"HIV takes several years to turn into full-blown AIDS. Those who died would have contracted the virus seven to eight years ago.\" She added that up to October this year 486 people have tested positive for HIV, while 76 are currently living with AIDS. Desai stressed that HIV cases have been on a decline in Goa for the last four years. While around 1,019 persons contracted the virus in 2008, the numbers dropped to 959 in 2009, 821 in 2010 and 665 in 2011. Of these 105 HIV-infected persons developed AIDS in 2008, 184 in 2009, 154 in 2010 and 106 in 2011. Stating that GSACS has so far tested the blood samples of just 3,62,414 people for HIV (the state's population is over 15 lakh), the project director said there could be more people with HIV in Goa. \"We work with high-risk groups that include commercial sex workers, and men who have sex with men. While most have tested for the virus, there may be some who have not come forward to test themselves,\" said Desai. She added, \"Besides, there may be some people who have done their blood tests at private laboratories. These laboratories do not provide their data to GSACS and their figures are therefore not on record.\""

Take this for instance. The Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) has so far carried out 17 deliveries both normal and caesarean on HIV-infected women. The number of was high in 2013-14 with 41 babies, according to a statistics available with the District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), Trichy. The number of babies born to HIV-infected women in the hospital is as follows (year-wise) - 37 in 2012-13, 65 in 2011-12, 66 in 2010-11 and 112 in 2009-10. Dr M Nagamani, obstetrics and gynaecologist in Trichy, said doctors have a sense of satisfaction for carrying out baby deliveries on HIV-infected women. \"Once we get to know that the patient is HIV-infected, we take precaution to ensure protection for us at the delivery room. At the same time, we get a sense of satisfaction in providing medical care to such people,\" said Dr Nagamani. District collector Jayashree Muralidharan advised the women to keep tab on their partners while speaking at the function organised on World Aids Day. She appreciated the doctors of MGMGH for their noble service. \"The prevention of AIDS could not be achieved by the government alone but it needs the cooperation from people as well. Women suffer a lot because of the misconduct of men. So, women should always keep vigil on their husbands,\" said the collector. R Senthilkumar, district programme manager (DPM) of DAPCU, said, \"Gone are the days when some of the doctors hesitated to treat HIV patients. Nowadays, many doctors have dedicated themselves in providing treatment to those patients despite having risk of transmission during operation. It is because of the doctors in government hospital, we could help HIV-infected pregnant woman to safely deliver a baby,\" said Senthilkumar."

The group aims to educate the society about HIV and hopes that its efforts will go a long way in battling the stigma and discrimination that come attached with the dreaded virus. Sandeep, who is the president of an NGO, People living with HIV, said that he comes across several cases of discrimination against HIV-positive people. \"There have been cases where the families of HIV-positive persons refused to perform their last rites. In such cases, we arranged for the funeral. No matter how modern our society becomes, their perception of HIV positive people doesn't change too much,\" said the Kalyan resident. Autorickshaw driver Akbar Khan (36), who was detected with HIV in 2002, has been having health problems for some time now. \"Not all healthcare centres are helpful to the HIV-positive. At times, I had to run around from hospital to hospital. Private hospitals would ask for a deposit, which I didn't have at the time,\" said the resident of Jarimari slum in Kurla. Then Khan heard about an insurance policy for HIV-positive patients. \"I took out the policy last year. I recently had a heart problem and was admitted to a private hospital. The policy really helped me. I felt like I was human too, just like other patients,\" said Khan, who is going to run in the marathon with Population Services International (PSI), the NGO that brought out the insurance policy for HIV-positive people. \"We want to tell the society that HIV-positive people can lead as normal a life as anyone else. They are physically fit, work and lead a normal life and should thus be treated as normally as others,\" said Ravi Subbiah, director of PSI Connect. Mohan, another HIV-positive, said, \"I want people to show support for those living with HIV. I hope to infuse strength in them.\" \"I am really excited about the marathon. This is the first time I will participate in such an event. In fact, we have arranged similar t-shirts for the event. The event is a good platform to help change the society's opinion on HIV and AIDS. I am proud to be part of this,\" said Khan. Sandeep said, \"Not everybody suffering from HIV is brave enough to come forward and speak about the virus and the disease.

The machine has proven useful for patients from 20 districts of eastern UP including Ballia, Pratapgarh, Sonbhadra, Kaushambi, Gonda and Fatehpur. Allahabad is the eighth city in the country to have the Gene Xpert device after Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Thiruvanthapuram. Dr OP Shahi, district tuberculosis officer told TOI that apart from 101 tests, the department had admitted 36 patients at Dott Plus site at medical college for treatment. He added that patients have been advised to stay for a week at Dott Plus site and are discharged after treatment. Dr Shahi said Gene Xpert is used for conducting a test -- Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (CBNAAT) -- approved and recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). He added that it can help in three times the detection of drug-resistant TB cases. With more fresh cases of TB-MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) surfacing every month in and around Allahabad region, Gene Xpert is proving useful for doctors. \"We have gone through all the exercises for Gene Xpert and are monitoring how the machine helps in early detection of TB and drug resistant TB,\" added Dr Shahi. He said the device is helpful in detecting cases of extremely drug resistant TB (XXDR-TB) as well and has been installed under the RNTCP (revised national TB control programme). The device is easy to install and can be used by paramedical staff. The new test aims to increase diagnosis of the deadly disease by at least seven-fold. Doctors say the device is fully integrated and can easily detect mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as Refampicin resistance-conferring mutations directly from sputum."

They fought against ignorance, myths, and socio-cultural taboos and broke through the wall of silence to lend voice to the voiceless. Inevitably, they ran into barriers. But determined to fight and overcome all odds, these young Muslim activists of Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (RRC) have today ushered in a silent revolution in this village. This includes an outreach strategy to address HIV+ prevention, care and support and treatment in this vulnerable district. Talking about sex was virtually taboo in this village, so for young Muslim girls, mostly in their teens, initiating any discussion on the issue was to invite controversy. But that is what Amina Khatoon, a 17-year-old girl, has done ever since she was made president of the 70-member RRC. She comes from a poor family and also works as a part-time dressmaker. April 14, 2009, was a memorable day for Amina when Nirdesh (an NGO) link worker Kumkum Kumari, formed the Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (KRRC) at the village with 21 girls. Prior to this, these girls had never come out in the open without \u2018purdah\u2019 and mingled with each other freely. The most sensitive and important issue about which they learnt was the disastrous effect of HIV/AIDS. \u201cI had to make a huge effort to make these girls understand the challenge of HIV/AIDS, particularly in rural areas, as here it becomes more pronounced in view of stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV, resulting in poor access to health care, and, above all, infections going undetected or treated by unqualified practitioners,\u201d said Kumkum. Soon these girls started spreading awareness about prevention and protection from HIV/AIDS among the rural community. They were also imparted training at various places, which changed their outlook and provided them a broader vision. The effort made by these girls was soon recognized by Unicef too. The girls were then provided a sewing machine and a ceiling fan. Today these girls, apart from generating social awareness are also learning skills like stitching, puppet-making, hosiery making etc to make their life better.

        "body": "MUMBAI: Amidst fears of rising infection and drying up of fund pool, the city has shown a healthy decline in HIV prevalence. The dip among high-risk population however continues to be very marginal. For instance, the incidence fell from 0.61% in 2013 to mere 0.59% in 2014. Mumbai continues to be one of the high-risk districts within the state given the migration patterns. Over 2.30 lakh population, including 28,000 female sex workers, 19,000 men having sex with men and 1800 intravenous drug users, fall within this category. Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) said that several steps are being taken to reach out to this population. \u201cWe are planning to open three new Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) at the Mumbai Port Trust. There will also be three mobile vans to facilitate testing among truckers,\u201d she said. It is estimated that over 20,000 truckers halt in the city at any given year. MDACS, which is the nodal body to tackle HIV in the city, was itself reeling under a fund crunch till two weeks ago. They also had to take a loan of Rs8crore from the BMC to tide over the crunch. \u201cIt has not slowed down our activities. We are aiming at zero infection and discrimination,\u201d she said. She added the body is adding two more antiretroviral centres to the existing dozen centres at Bhabha Hospital in Bandra and Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar. Acharya added that the rates of mother-to-child transmission have also been steadily declining. From 1.10% in 2008-09 it has dropped to 0.25% in 2012-13. \u201cThe new multidrug regimen for prevention of HIV among newborns is working well,\u201d she said. Around two years after the HIV epidemic hit home, the Maharashtra Aids Control Society (MSACS) has initiated a programme to trace patients who have been enrolled for care at some point. \u201cCurrently, at least 50,000 patients are lost to follow up, who may have died or migrated to other places. We will find them and give a unique number,\u201d said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS."

At a press meet here on Wednesday, Ramdas said the trust, in association with Asare Foundation, is treating HIV-infected children at its research centre \u2018Amma Mane\u2019. \u201cDue to the treatment provided at the centre, children\u2019s health is improving. They have also increased their food consumption to around 400 grams. Their blood samples will be sent to Veda Research Centre in London for examination,\u201d he said. Ramdas said the HIV-infected children usually wake up around 4.30 am and practice yogasana, agnihotra and prayers. Later, they are given food made of millets (siridhanya). The treatment goes on for five years, but results can be seen within three years, he said. On the Chamundi Hills trek which has been organised by various organisations at 6.30 am on December 1, he said: \u201cAround 20 children from Amma Mane along with other children will participate in the trek. They will visit the temple and pray for good health of all the children.\u201d"

        "body": "TRICHY: Like normal people, HIV affected people are also longing to enter wedlock to renew their lives with much-needed positivity. In Trichy, the desire for remarriage is growing among widowers. However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry. According to statistics from the district administration, there are 11,097 people including 6,654 males and 4,443 females who are HIV positive. Most of the women are said to have received the killer syndrome from their husbands. With a view to finding a suitable life partner for both men and women patients, two marriage information bureaus exclusively for HIV people have been functioning in Trichy for the past six years. The marriage bureaus neither encourage nor discourage marriage. They simply explain to them the merits and demerits of marriage and let the parties decide. On the other hand, the counsellors believe that such marriages might prevent HIV positive men from spreading the virus through affairs. The two marriage bureaus have so far received about 250 applications seeking life partners. Interestingly, most of the applicants are widowers between 30 and 50. However, the number of widow applicants are nearly 50. Since there is a possibility that babies born to such couples will become HIV-affected, the marriage bureaus counsel the pairs to have safe sex to avoid having children. But the couples seemingly want to have children. The HIV-affected men want to get married for various social and personal reasons. \"The decision to remarry involves many reasons. First, many widowers do not want to expose themselves by being alone. So, they want to marry to hide their disease. Some of them are forced by their families to get married. There are many persons who want to enter wedlock for marital consummation. Interestingly, a 50-year-old man has now applied for remarriage. Since 2008, we received 39 applications from men and five applications from women. But only 12 marriages have taken place so far and seven children have been born through such marriages. All the children tested HIV negative,\" said A Thamil, a HIV positive person who runs Network for Positive People in Trichy. Thamil also said, \"Most women are affected by HIV because of their husbands. Many of them have begotten children through their marriage. Unfortunately, the sudden deaths of their husbands put the future of both mother and child at risk. Nevertheless, they do not want to think of remarriage because they do not want to lead a volatile life.\""

Talking to TOI on Saturday, an official of the health department said, \u201cThe project will be in joint collaboration with Red Cross as it has received grants of Rs 21.5 lakh for the project. The centre will include 10 beds for HIV patients.\u201d He said the centre would motivate chronic patients whose families fail to support them in terms of treatment, besides giving them adequate diet. The official said work had already kicked off and the community care centre would open in the Red Cross building near Civil Hospital. He said a doctor, counsellor, three nurses, four outreach health workers, one part-time lab technician, along with a project coordinator and dietician had been appointed for the job. Notably, NACO is working on the oral substitution therapy for intravenous drug users so as to control incidence of HIV and for this, work on opening the drug addiction centre is going on. Dr Geetika Kansal, district aids programme officer said the move had been taken under NACO phase III and was aimed at chronic patients, who could not afford treatment."

According to Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS), 500 new cases have been detected in the first three months of this year alone, which has taken the total number of HIV and AIDS cases to 7500. Till May last year, the total number of such cases was 6500, which increased to 7000 at the end of the year. In Kamrup district alone, 3737 cases have been detected so far, which is the highest in the state followed by Cachar district where 1308 cases have been detected so far. Speaking at a workshop on legal awareness and awareness on AIDS organized by Assam State Commission for Women and ASACS, additional project director of ASACS, Pabin Talukdar, said, \"The rate of HIV and AIDS cases is alarmingly increasing in the state even after carrying out various awareness programmes, free treatment, providing facilities to the victims and the relatives. At present, the number of cases detected are among the youngsters because of unprotected sex, sex before marriage and more intake of drugs.\" The ASACS data show that 98.13 per cent cases of HIV and AIDS in the state have occurred from unprotected sex, 2.85 per cent from injecting drug users, 1.49 per cent through blood transfusion and three per cent from unspecified sources. The data further added that three per cent of HIV and AIDS cases have been reported in pregnant women. He said maximum cases have been detected in Kamrup, Cachar, Golaghat, Nagaon and Dibrugarh districts. \"We are putting in all efforts to control the disease but we have failed to achieve the desired target,\" said Talukdar."

According to the study, a whopping 83% of the children covered inherited the deadly disease from their mothers while the rest were infected through blood transfusion. \"There is a need to prevent transmission of HIV from mother with appropriate intervention. Our focus should be to reach out to the unreachable so that the follow up is universal,\" said Dr Ivonne Camaroni of Unicef India's chief HIV section. The two-year study covered 18 districts across the state and mapped 1,639 children from 995 families where either of the parents or both are HIV positive. Of them, 857 children were found infected with the virus. North 24-Parganas topped the list with 124 infected children, followed by South 24-Parganas, with 78 children, while 72 were traced in Kolkata. As many as 65% of the mothers covered in the study did not receive prevention on parent-to-child transmission services during their late stages of pregnancy. Only 16% of the infected children are on anti-retroviral treatment while 75% of them live in areas from where they have to travel at least 100 kilometres to access healthcare facilities. Since about 72% of the families fall under the below poverty line category, most are unable to travel that far to avail the facilities. \"The report's findings give us a glimpse into the harsh reality faced by children and families living with HIV/AIDS,\" said Lori Calvo, Unicef West Bengal chief. The mapping, however, covered only children of parents who are members of HIV positive network. According to West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS), the state has about 1500 HIV positive children. \"This is only an estimate and does not reflect the exact figure. Despite efforts to eliminate new infection to children, there have been challenges,\" said WBSACPS project director Dr RK Vats. The report of the study was released during a state consultation on children living with HIV, organized by Unicef in association with WBSACPS."

The window period is phase between contracting HIV and detection of virus in patients. According to doctors, blood banks rely heavily on ELISA test to screen HIV-carrier patients. \"ELISA test is not a confirmatory test for detecting HIV in its window period among blood donors. It poses high risk even though blood banks screen patients on different parameters. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method is the only confirmatory test to detect HIV in its window period. The test is hardly done in any of the blood banks. It should be introduced in tertiary care centres,\" said MYH blood bank in charge Ashok Yadav. Choithram Hospital, head of pathology department, Dr DS Chitnis, said, \"We opt for fourth generation Elisa test, which enhances chances of detection of HIV at an early stage. It is the latest available test.\" However, experts do not suggest the test as it does not confirm chances of the virus among patients. Medical education department Dr SS Kushwah said, \"As per government policies, currently, Elisa test is being used to screen blood for HIV though it is not a confirmatory test.\" Indore has highest number of HIV/ AIDS-infected patients in state and most blood banks rely on professional donors."

        "body": "MUMBAI: In July 2001, four staffers from a non-governmental organization in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men (MSM) were arrested and charged with the stringent IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for sale obscene material among other offences. They were jailed for 47 days, their HIV/AIDS- related material seized and the offices of their NGOs Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust sealed. Health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi endured similar harassment, noted Human Rights Watch in its publication \"Epidemic of Abuse-Police Harassment of HIV/AIDS outreach workers\". The document highlights a bitter reality of India\u2019s battle against HIV/AIDS\u2014fighting the disease becomes an uphill task when criminality is attached to vulnerable communities. Much of these challenges associated with fighting HIV/AIDS were overcome thanks to the Delhi High Court judgement decriminalising same-sex relations in 2009. But they have been resurrected with the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement on Wednesday. Activists fear the judgment will pose a huge setback for HIV/AIDS. \"It will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days it was very hard to get MSMs to health units as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgement,\" says Dr. L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. He pointed out that the apex court\u2019s judgement was likely to give legal backing to the biases of healthcare professionals and could fuel their discriminatory attitudes. The issue is particularly pressing as MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. Roughly seven per cent of the estimated 25 lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalisation in healthcare was in fact the basis of the Public Interest Litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in the Delhi HC. The National AIDS Control Organization too had admitted in its affidavit that Section 377 acted as a \"serious impediment\" to successful public health interventions. \"Those in the high risk group are mostly reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,\" stated the NACO affidavit. It had pointed out that social stigma forced many MSMs to deny their behaviour, thereby marrying or having sex with female partners and subsequently putting them too at the risk of HIV/AIDS. Ashok Row Kavi of the Humsafar Trust too echoed these concerns. \"It will put us in grave trouble. But the NACO\u2019s progressive schemes have helped the community and we will continue that work,\" he said. The negative impact * Gay persons would be afraid to approach healthcare systems as they could be reported under Section 377. * The judgment would make healthcare workers who work with LGBTQ (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, queer) communities vulnerable to police harassment for \u2018promoting\u2019 illegality. * Social stigma could force MSMs to deny their sexual behaviour, marry women and have sex with female partners putting them at the risk of HIV/AIDS."

        "body": "AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry out further probe and nail criminal liability in connection with thalassaemic kids contracting HIV through blood transfusion at the Junagadh civil hospital. The court rejected clean chit to all concerned authorities given by the probe agency. The court granted 60-day time to the central agency to complete further probe on specific issues and submit the report. Expressing dissatisfaction over CBI's closure report by terming it 'incomplete', the court said that it was necessary to get the issue probed further. The court said that the Gujarat high court had transferred the probe to CBI to get this subject investigated in minute detail. \"It is necessary to probe the issue further. It could lead to the root of the matter and clarify on who are the responsible persons,\" the court said. Last year, CBI had filed a closure report by giving clean chit to Mahendra Mashroo, local BJP MLA, who runs Sarvodaya Blood Bank from where the blood was sourced by the government hospital, for transfusion into the thalassaemic children. Blood transfusion also took place there. However, it was later revealed that the thalassaemic children were HIV positive and several of them had passed away since 2011. Parents of 34 such thalassaemic kids fought a long legal battle and finally sought further probe after CBI filed a closure report claiming that there could be various reasons behind the thalassaemic kids contracting HIV. The court agreed with arguments put forth by their counsel Paresh Waghela in case of three girls, who got treatment only at Junagadh civil hospital and obtained blood from Sarvodaya Blood Bank. The question raised was how these three contracted HIV. CBI found one blood donor with HIV positive, whose blood led to one child being infected with HIV after a few months. When the picture was so clear, why CBI did not fix liability on any authority at the hospital or blood bank and nobody was held responsible, the Waghela had argued. CBI also did not inquire beyond 529 persons out of the total 1,229 identified donors."

The condition of such patients, who stop responding to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), continues to deteriorate despite restarting earlier medication. So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment. \u201cWe keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines. But some of them do land up with first line failure and have to be put on second line. GMCH started this facility last year. The viral load in these patients is extremely high. We identify them, send them to Mumbai to assess viral load, and if they need second line ART, they are put on it immediately,\u201d said professor and head of medicine at GMCH Dr YB Bansod. Second line of ART is available at only five centres in the state, at the government medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Sangli. Till October this year, total 1,546 patients were on second line. City has second line ART centre at GMCH, where 144 patients; 124 men, 17 women and 3 children, are being treated. Patients say that lack of awareness, carelessness, casual attitude and poverty play a big role in the discontinuation of medicine, leading to second line treatment. Kalabai was told of her positive status during pregnancy tests at GMCH. Since she was put on mother to child prevention drugs, her son is negative. Being poor, she had taken shelter in a missionary ashram for some time, and has now left her son there to study. Others on second line have similar experiences. Sunita from Yavatmal was accompanying her husband who is on second line. \u201cI didn\u2019t feed my daughter . I am also positive, but my daughter is not. I work as a maid to keep the family going since my husband gave up his job as a driver. He caught HIV from sexual relationships while away on the job,\u201d she said in a choked voice. Surekha (51) from Umrer tested positive only after her husband died, and is now on second line. Her two grown up sons take care of her. Ramratan, from a village near Pandhurna, admits he had sexual relations with CSWs, which led to the HIV. \u201cNow, I have no means of earning my daily bread. My brother supports me with food and travel charges,\u201d he said. Subhash from Jharkhand, now a resident of Nagpur, too admits he had multiple sexual partners while working as a driver. Put on second line about four months back, he has brought his family to Nagpur and told his wife and children about having tested positive for HIV. Surprisingly, Sanjiv Waghmare, a sanitary worker, claims that he never missed his medicine, and yet landed up with failure of first line. \u201cI had an alarm in the mobile and would stop anywhere to take the medicine when it rang. God knows why I still developed resistance,\u201d he said."

The blood banks which are using the technique of testing the donated blood is Elisa test. A health department official said Elisa test is used to test the blood donated by a donor for blood safety. But, it has its own limitation. If a person is infected with HIV today, the test will not be able to detect HIV virus in the person for at least four weeks of being infected as it is the window period. It is a period when a person infected with HIV will test negative for HIV. But, NAT is much more improved testing which blood banks should have for ensuring blood safety. The official said that there is at least four week of window period after that Elisa test detect the HIV successfully. But in NAT, it detects successfully within the window period. He said that the various blood banks in other states have started using it but in Rajasthan, there is only one blood bank which is located in a private hospital in Jaipur, the health department official said. Just like for HIV, the Elisa test takes the same time as in case of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C of four weeks to three months. The official said that if a person is infected with HIV of hepatitis B or C today and he donated blood for transfusion into other patient, there is a risk of the person to be infected with HIV as the Elisa test cannot detect it so early.

Raj Vaidya who works for Positive People, a NGO working for HIV/AIDS, says besides creating awareness, more importantly, GSACS will have to now work towards doing away with stigma, and discrimination that HIV-infected people face. \"A lot of work has to be done,\" he says indicating that it will be a mammoth task. Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, who is well aware of the task before her, said though they have started awareness programmes and workshops are being conducted, she says it will be a while before people come to really understand the issue and bury their prejudices. She said the issue is complicated as there is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Present day parents, most of whom have one or two children, become too protective about their children even though HIV is not contagious. \"Two or three decades ago, parents rarely bothered who their children's classmates in schools were, with whom they play with. But today the scene is different,\" she says. The situation, she says is not synonymous to Goa alone. \"It is a phobia among the general population and the disease is a stumbling block,\" she says. In their revised efforts to ally fear about HIV/AIDS among the general population, she said they have started involving people at all levels. \"We are engaging panchayat representatives, health officials and other to pass on the message,\" she added. A school teacher from a Mapusa school said many teachers are themselves ignorant about the disease or at times, despite of being well aware that merely touching or sitting next to a HIV-positive person will not get them an infection, they will still refuse to mix with HIV-positive persons. \"This I have gathered from hearing teachers talk in the staffroom. What they feel about HIV-infected people. It is sad,\" she said. She feels efforts should be made on all fronts to enlighten people about HIV, so that infected people are treated with dignity. Vaidya also observed the efforts should not be half-hearted otherwise in future there will be more instances of schools closing their doors on children suffering HIV."

        "body": "MANGALORE: From being a red zone for HIV infection a decade back, Dakshina Kannada district has moved towards 0.25% prevalence, which is half of state's estimated adult HIV prevalence. \"The positive cases have come down drastically by more than half from 2007 numbers. If the positive cases were about 1,245 in 2007 about 90 cases being reported per month, including pregnant women, now the cases are averaging less 50 per month,\" said Dr Kishore Kumar M, District AIDS Control officer. He pointed out that while in 2007, the test to positive ration was 16% in 2013 it has come to as low as 1.45%. Delineating the statistics, he said, \"In 2007 of the 7,986 persons tested 1,245 were tested positive, in 2013 (till October end) of the 38,985 tested only 567 were positive cases. Last year, as many as 38,294 went in for testing and there were 867 cases. This year, we expect the test number to reach 44,000,\" he said. Dr Kishore said the positive development was that every year from 2007 the cases were coming down by more than 100, hoping to achieve better progress in next couple of years. The most heartening fact is the effective control of transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy. Nearly five per cent of infections are attributable to parent-to-child-transmission. Dr Kishore pointed out that froma high of 82 cases in 2007 among 14,764 pregnant women tested, the numbers had come down to 23 in 2012 among 23,575 tested. This year till October 21 cases have been reported among 22,141 tested. Among the cases reported this year till October, Mangalore taluk has the highest number at 214, followed by Bantwal (51), Belthangady (45), Puttur 927) and Sullia taluk reported 15 cases. The rest of the 215 cases are from other districts tested here. Again male numbers are high at 364 followed by women at 203. The prevalence among persons in the age group of 15 to 49 is highest at 472 and it is 80 above age of 49. As of now, from 2006 till date 2,492 persons are being administered ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment). Dr Kishore said HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3. Earlier the threshold was 250. Antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis."

        "body": "MANGALORE: The response for the scheme of reimbursing travel fare for HIV positive patients, who visit Anti-Retro Viral Treatment (ART) centres for therapy, has been good in Dakshina Kannada. The scheme was launched by the department of health and family welfare and Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS) in January 2013. Before the launch of this scheme, many poor HIV patients, mainly those residing in rural areas, did not visit ART centres regularly for treatment as they couldn\u2019t afford the travel fare from their homes to the centres. Six ART centres are situated in different parts of DK district, including two centres in Mangalore city. Dr Kishore Kumar, DK district AIDS control officer, told TOI that an average of 60 HIV patients visit each ART centre a day for treatment. There are 1,600 patients registered in ART centres which provide free treatment, he said. Before the travel fare reimbursement fee scheme was introduced, around 20 patients were skipping their regular visits to ART centres every day. But in the past few months, this number has come down to three, he added. \u201cLast year, when we contacted patients about why they weren\u2019t visiting ART centres, they\u2019d say they cannot afford the travel expense,\u201d said Dr Kishore. He said patients who travel from rural areas to ART centres are reimbursed 80 paisa per kilometre to and fro, while patients within city limits are given Rs 40. After undergoing treatment, patients\u2019 travel expenses are reimbursed at the ART centres. Expenses are also reimbursed for one caretaker who accompanies any HIV patients under 10 years or over 60 years of age, said Dr Kishore. Urging patients to make use of the scheme and free treatment, he said they have to visit the centres once a month. Missing out on a monthly visit is dangerous as it could lead to resistance towards the drug.

The attacker hit Jyothi, threw her down, and left her lying inside the kiosk at one of the city's busiest locations, Corporation Circle, in broad daylight. It was a brazen attack, facilitated by the lack of security. The nature and time of the attack raises the question as to why the kiosk was left unguarded. The Corporation Bank management said the bank has not employed a guard at this ATM centre, though they have one for the bank, about 5 metres away. While police believe it is inexplicable that even big banks fail to follow simple security measures, they are quick to point out that the Reserve Bank of India guidelines do not prescribe a mandatory security guard. A senior RBI official told TOI from Mumbai: \"Banks have some responsibility. They operate independently and not everything needs to be written and sent to them.\" The official also pointed out that the apex bank has, in fact, given specific guidelines to employ security guards at ATM centres located in remote areas and those in the proximity of educational institutions. \"We have also issued guidelines directing banks to relocate or completely remove ATM kiosks from remotely-populated areas as they are vulnerable to crime,\" she said, adding there are guidelines which mandate that banks have an arrangement with local police in sensitive places or where thefts are common. Police sources believe there's a clear lack of intent on the part of banks in keep ATMs secured, despite repeated attempts of theft and attacks. \"We cannot be omnipresent. Every premises is as much the responsibility of the people who run it,\" an officer said. RBI GUIDELINES FOR ATMs Tampering: Caretakers at offsite ATMs and sensitive locations to discourage attempts to tamper with ATM Easy cash: Disabling cash retraction facility, as fraudsters take advantage of it Pin code: Security screen on machine requiring customer to confirm the digits entered, reduction of per screen transaction time, logging out a customer in case of even a single invalid pin Dip cards: Dip-card readers to pre-empt capture of data through extraneous devices Mystery shopping: Analysis of complaints to identify complaint-prone ATMs and monitoring of transactions here"

These voluntary health camps will be held from October 21 to 27. According to RSACS, the migrating population - local residents working elsewhere and returning home for holidays - is one of the sections vulnerable to HIV. In such camps, organised last year during Diwali, RSACS found that the prevalence of HIV was almost double in villages with high concentration of migrants. The agency found that 0.59% of such population had HIV. All those who tested HIV positive during the screenings were advised to undergo second and third round of confirmatory tests. As per official estimates, 20,037 persons were screened for HIV at 10-day camps organised in 100 villages of 11 districts last year. The villages were identified on the basis of large number of people migrating to other states for work and returning during the festive season. District collector Pali Kumar Pal Gautam said that six places have been identified in Pali for voluntary health camps. These camps will also provide care for those suffering from other diseases. He said that during Diwali people who had gone to other states for work returned to the district for the festival. The camps will also offer other healthcare facilities."

The Foundation had set up four hospitals across South India two years ago, to curb the spread of HIV in the region. They were established at Bagalkot (Karnataka), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Tiruchi (Kerala) and Kakinada (Tamil Nadu). The US-based Global Foundation For AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had given financial support for the treatment of patients suffering from these three major diseases. A Chennai-based voluntary organization, Population of India, took help from the Foundation to set up these hospitals, which came as a boon to HIV-infected persons. The Bagalkot hospital, which started out in a rented house in Godi, on Muchakhandi Road, served patients from North Karnataka. The hospital had a 50-bed capacity. More than 4,157 HIV-affected people have been treated in this hospital till today, but fatalities have been a mere 400. The main reason for the hospital shutting down is that GFATM announced that it would discontinue funding. The agreement contract was not renewed from March 31, 2010. The closure procedure began on March 15, with patients being shifted to the government hospital. Equipment worth Rs 30 lakh was returned to the parent organization. It has also affected 32 staff working here, but it is patients who are worst hit. While the government is thinking of opening a separate section in the district hospital, it remains to be seen if these patients can be served round-the-clock and as efficiently. Several NGOs, social workers and industrialists approached the elected representatives to keep the hospital going, but till today, there has been no response from the authorities. Bagalkot district has a high number of HIV-positive patients, and with the closure of the hospital, the ball is now in the government's court."

For the children, who routinely spend their life in the centre and school, the trip turned out to be pleasant. The children, aged between six and 20, had the chance to enjoy the journey in plush cars, a couple of hours in Vishaal de Mal and a splendid evening at Eco Park at Thiruparankundram. This is the first time they were getting a glimpse of the city's posh shopping mall and Eco Park. The trip was organised by Rotary Club of Madurai Meenakshi along with Indian Red Cross Society, Madurai branch. The children are orphans, whose parents died of HIV. Children from various districts including Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Virudhunagar also stay in the centre. \"The trip was an unforgettable day in their life, as they visited places for the first time,\" said K Sakthi Anand, programme manager of the centre.

Vignesh, an eighth standard boy, who was excited, said, \"I loved my maiden visit to a shopping mall. The moving bull there was my favourite. The entire day was fun with friends. The other playing equipment which we enjoyed there, otherwise I have seen only in television,\" he said. Ponmani, a 12th standard girl said, \"The devil house was a thrilling experience. Despite it being frightening, we loved it so much. Spending time in the toy helicopter was the other attraction for us.\" \"Videos shown in the 7D theatre were a crowd-puller.

They have already spoken with and written letters to officials from health department, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Organisation (MSACS) and several important leaders of the city.

While almost all the participants were in favour of encouraging tests, the opinion on whether to make these mandatory was divided.

With representatives of NGOs were against making the tests mandatory, the department, said sources, could drop the suggestion of compulsory tests.

        "body": "PUNE: The medical expenses incurred by families who have at least one HIV positive member are a serious strain on their finances, pushing many of them into a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d. This was revealed in a field survey of 401 such families in the city, undertaken by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) to gauge the economic profile of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level. The families surveyed are registered with a city NGO, which works towards providing socio-psycho, legal support and counselling to PLHIV. Though the study included households from all strata of society, and from varied economic backgrounds, nearly 50% of the sample group was from the lower economic categories. The study was completed under the guidance of Sanjeevanee Mulay, former associate professor at GIPE. Varun Sharma, who undertook the study, is a former senior research fellow at GIPE and currently assistant professor at the Institute of Health Management Research (IHMR) in Bangalore. He said the study was an attempt to estimate the relationship between HIV prevalence and poverty. \u201cWe cannot overlook the fact that PLHIV from the lower socio-economic background, especially from the slum areas in cities like Pune, are most vulnerable. This should be considered while drafting policies and programmes concerning HIV,\u201d he said. Sharma said the study used economic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Standard of Living Index (SLI). Based on these two indices, the study found that families with HIV+ persons are more destitute compared to other families. \u201cThis is especially true of households run by HIV+ women. The study revealed that 70% of the sample households managed by women have a middle socio-economic status whereas about 50% of them can be categorised as the \u2018poorest of the poor\u2019. In comparison, only 30% of households run by men fit in the category. The reason for this may be that, in general, a woman\u2019s income is less than that of a man,\u201d he said. The study revealed that though anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating HIV is free at the public health centres, HIV+ people have to spend from their own pockets on other illnesses and ailments which come with the HIV infection, Sharma said. \u201cThe economic burden is more on those who are already poor, and it leads to medical poverty trap. In the analysis, we found that there is a sharp increase of 20% BPL headcounts, when adjusted for out-of-pocket health spending,\u201d he said. HIV+ people from the upper and middle socio-economic backgrounds usually opt for private health facilities, which are better, and also because it offers them a privacy. Sharma said a comparison between the families surveyed and the city\u2019s non-HIV urban households (surveyed under the national reproductive and child health programme) confirmed that a majority of PLHIV households either came from the lower economic strata of society or had gradually become impoverished over a period of time. According to the study, 36.9% households with HIV+ members had a low standard of living. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, coordinator, Prayas Health Group, which treats more than 3,500 HIV/AIDS patients from the city and other parts of the country at its clinic, said special focus on widowed women diagnosed with HIV is needed. \u201cAround 33% of the total population of HIV infected women belongs to this category. Implementation of policies that address the needs of such sections of society is imperative,\u201d she said."

The girl, from Mananthawady in Wayanad, is suffering from Thalassemia and has been undergoing regular blood transfusion at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and district hospital, Mananthawadi, for the past six-and-a-half years. It is suspected that the girl got infected with HIV either from contaminated blood or an inadequately sterilized syringe. After a test in July 2012 first showed her to be HIV positive, the girl was again subjected to the Elisa test in September, which confirmed the earlier result. Her relatives, including her parents and three-year-old sibling, also underwent the test but all of them tested negative. Wayanad district medical officer Dr Sameera said there was no lapse on her part as she had informed the Kerala AIDS control society soon after the girl's parents informed her about the development. Kozhikode Medical College authorities too said there was little chance of the girl getting HIV infected during blood transfusion at the hospital because the blood bank screened all donors. However, Dr Ramani, additional director of health services who met relatives of the girl at Wayanad, hinted at a possible loophole in this screening process when she explained that if the blood of an HIV positive person is in the window period (within 20-25 days of contracting the disease), the disease cannot be detected in Elisa test. State health minister V S Sivakumar termed the incident sad and unfortunate and said all precautions will be taken to ensure it is not repeated."

        "body": "We all know enough about HIV yet it remains one of the most dreaded diseases across the globe; yet another HIV-like disease, which is a time bomb waiting to explode goes unnoticed by many. Introducing Hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver and is a leading cause of death and disability across the world. The disease is backed by some startling facts. A recent study published in The Lancet journal stated that viral hepatitis deaths increased by 63 per cent in the last 23 years. For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Hepatitis A and E are waterborne; Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by bodily fluids (via syringes, needles, injections, toothbrush, razors). Furthermore, all of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Dr. Ajay P Choksi, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Gastroenterology & Hepatology at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai explains, \"Hepatitis A and E are generally self limiting and don't normally last beyond six months. However, they can be severe, incapacitating and fatal during this period. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HBC), on the other hand, can give rise to acute illnesses like A (HBA) and E (HBE) but can also cause chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver or even cancer of liver. Hepatitis D (HBD) infection occurs only if a person has Hepatitis B.\" Shockingly, there have been a surge in deaths in the past 20 years. \"Despite alarming statistics, we as a country have not undertaken enough clinical research. Of the five, there is no cure for three of them. Hepatitis C alone affects estimated 12 million people in India, most of whom don't even know they are carriers. The combined burden of viral hepatitis is huge in India. We need treatment regimens that are short and therapies that are effective, affordable and well-tolerated,\" shares Suneela Thatte, President, Indian Society of Clinical Research (ISCR). World Health Organisation has stated that a shocking 95 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis B or C do not even know they are infected and often live without symptoms for a long time. This year alone, 10 to 30 million people will be infected with HBV. Dr Harshwardhan Dongre, K J Somaiya Hospital warns, \"Currently there is no treatment for acute Hepatitis B infection. Progression to chronic disease depends on a host of factors, so preventing acute infection is the only preventive measure available.\" Dr. PM Bhujang \u2013 President, Association of Hospitals adds, \"Acute infection may present as fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and dark urine. Chronic hepatitis may present with early and late symptoms of liver dysfunction and failure.\" Unlike Hepatitis B, C and D, Hepatitis A and E do not damage the liver in the long term. \"Once infected or vaccinated, we do not get the infection again,\" adds Dr Vasudevan K R, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation department, Jaypee Hospital, Noida. Prevention plan Most of the viral hepatitis have vaccinations and so the first plan should be to get yourself duly immunized against them. Follow the below guidelines: - Avoid sharing sharp objects for example, needles, razor and toothbrush. - Avoid unprotected sex. - Three dosages of hepatitis B vaccine given at intervals of 0-1-6 months would give immunity against Hepatitis B at more than 95% probability. - All infants should be immunised against hepatitis B in 1st year of life. - All pregnant ladies should be screened for hepatitis B & C and if found positive, adequate measures should be taken to prevent transmission. - No open wound should be contacted without gloves. Facts and myths Dr. Neeraj Saraf, Associate Director - Hepatology, Medanta - The Medicity lays busts some common myths Myths and facts of Hepatitis B Myths: People infected with viral hepatitis B never recover. Facts: Ninety percent of infected adults with acute hepatitis B can recover without any problems, but most infected babies and children eventually develop chronic hepatitis B infection, where recovery is not possible. New antiviral treatments may reduce the incidence of complications by suppressing the virus and preventing progression of the disease. Myths: Viral Hepatitis B cannot be prevented. Facts: The Viral Hepatitis B vaccine is absolutely safe and extremely effective. It only takes 3 shots to protect against viral hepatitis B. Myths and facts of Hepatitis C Myths: You\u2019ve been vaccinated for Hepatitis C Facts: No vaccine currently exists for hepatitis C therefore you cannot be vaccinated for hepatitis C.

Lata Singh, programme cordinator of FXB India Suraksha, said 15 lakh children are homeless due to HIV in India. The situation is getting worse in Rajasthan despite the government's massive awareness programmes, she added. \"Jaipur has around 2,000 HIV positive children. This data is collected with the help of NGOs and hospitals. However, many of them are out of the reach of both,\" added Singh. Suraksha organised this programme at Virandavan marriage garden. They called around 20 HIV positive children along with activist working for rights of these children and government officials. During the programme some children narrated their tragic tales through songs. Sukhdev Singh (name changed) (14), a HIV positive says how his uncle abandoned him outside railway station in Solapur barely months after the death of his parents in a road accident. After living at the mercy of beggars at the station for some days, he came to Jaipur on the train and started consuming drugs. Here he was spotted by this NGO. After a medical test it was revealed that he is HIV positive. Since then, he underwent many counselling sessions and started going to school. Singh fears that people discriminate against HIV positives despite the government's massive awareness programmes. RU Professor Shashi Sahay addressed HIV positive students. She said that biggest challenge for civil society is to bring them into the mainstream."

The centre came out with this damning report after conducting several studies on the subject. The centre's director Shashi Sahay, who closely worked with the HIV+ people, found patients living in the interior areas are irregular in collecting medicines from the free medicine distribution centres. \"Patients, especially women face apathy even from their family. In many cases, we find that they were kept in solitary confinement. The government is not keeping any record of such patients who were irregular in collecting medicines,\" she said. In many cases, they found that medicines to keep them fit become ineffective owing to malnourishment. Sahay cautioned the government that since state is turning into educational hub, Kota being one such example, youngsters are likely to indulge in activities which could contract HIV. \"Youth from all over the country in thousands are living here away from their families and therefore the probability to succumb to wrongful activities is higher,\" Sahay said. City-based NGOs working for HIV/AIDS left no stone unturned to organise several programmes creating awareness. RAYS organised a bike rally called BIKE-THON participated by motorcyclists and HIV+ children. The rally was kicked-off by Bollywood director Kabir Khan. Eighteen-month-old, Khushi, was the youngest HIV+ orphan at the event. \"Since Khushi came to our centre, all other kids have got little toys to play with. We have appointed one caretaker especially for Khushi,\" said Gurinder Virk, vice-president of RAYS adding that they adopted Khushi two months back. Nearly 30 children of Faith NGO presented a play at a private hospital and left audience spellbound."

Just when United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS) has praised India for reducing new HIV infection rate by 57% in a decade, news from Mumbai shows that the number of patients put on life-saving drugs has almost doubled in the last five years. Figures released by the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) on the eve of World AIDS Day show that 36,920 HIV patients in the city have been put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) over the years. The therapy has been instrumental in changing the perception of AIDS from being a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. \"This is a 96.2% increase in the number of patients taking ART since 2008,\" said Dr B Adsul, additional project director at MDACS. The numbers show that the AIDS-control programme is spreading wider into the community. The city's government-aided AIDS control programme has registrations of 67,326 patients across the city. \"In the last five years, we have managed to increase the number of patients coming to us for treatment by 60%,'' added Dr Adsul. That HIV-positive individuals are living healthier lives can be gauged from the fact almost 40% of the registered patients don't need ART yet, said a MDACS official. This means their blood counts aren't yet plunging to levels that need ART,'' they said. The MDACS, which works under the civic bodymunicipal corporation of Greater Mumbai, operates 69 centres for testing and counselling patients as well as 10 centres to distribute ART medicines. In the last five years, the number of people getting themselves checked for the disease has gone up by 39% and the HIV positivity among these patients has decreased by 56%. The number of pregnant women getting themselves checked for HIV has increased by 5%.

And the notion that youth are becoming more conscious about HIV and are now more open to getting themselves tested for the virus even before marriage seems a misconception. According to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Civil Hospital, 345 persons including 121 women had visited the centre for HIV testing during January while just three of them were unmarried. In fact, 105 of the total number of visitors belonged to the 15 to 24 years age group. Paramjit Kaur, a counsellor at the centre, said hardly any body comes for HIV testing before entering the nuptials except those who were Injected Drug Users (IDUs), adding that most of the women visitors were married and got themselves tested after getting infection from their husbands. She said one in every three unmarried persons who came there for HIV testing was below 14 while the rest of the two were IDUs. Geetika, district project manager for AIDS, said people here in Ludhiana were not so aware about the need for getting tested for HIV. She said NACO was working hard to create awareness among the youth and guide them to be open to their partners before getting married. She said NACO had undertaken various activities to create awareness among youth. She said they conduct activities under Information, Education and Communication (IEC) programme, adding that they conduct street-plays, advertise through local events, signboards on roads, advertisements on television and radio, lectures and seminars. She said there were people who were so ignorant about HIV that they would not take precautions against getting infected by the virus and would not get themselves tested, adding there was a need to raise awareness among the city's youth to prevent spread of the disease."

A layman's perceived threat of illness from a patient can still find some takers. However, medical practitioners refusing to conduct a postmortem of a person, just because he was an HIV victim, defeats the very purpose of the campaign to sensitize public about HIV patients. A team of doctors at SMS hospital allegedly refused to conduct postmortem of an HIV positive patient who committed suicide on Sunday evening at his residence in Harijan Basti. They cited 'infection risk to staff' as the reason. Furthermore, the doctors even asked the deceased's family members to give it in writing that they don't want a postmortem report. The police officers, however, were adamant. According to the police, around 9.30 pm on Sunday they received information about a 23-year-old youth, an HIV patient, who had committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling fan in his house. He was fighting the disease for the past six months. The police said that he was upset about his health condition which prompted him to take the fatal step. A team from the Sadar police station rushed to the spot, and took him to the SMS hospital where he was declared brought dead. A team of doctors, however, refused to conduct the post-mortem of the body. They even urged his family to give a written consent stating they don't want to go for a post-mortem. \"Since it was a suicide, it was compulsory for us to furnish documents like postmortem and viscera reports. The doctors tried convincing the family of the deceased,\" said Rajendra Singh, circle inspector, Sadar police station on Monday. The police, finally, had their way and by 11 am the doctors had started with the procedure."

Its hit list includes human rhinoviruses - the bugs that causes colds in adults and in children - flu, polio, a stomach bug and deadly dengue fever. But DRACO is also expected to zap measles and German measles, cold sores, rabies and even HIV - and could be on pharmacy shelves in a decade, the Daily Mail reported. Lead researcher Mike Rider said, \"It's certainly possible that there's some virus that we aren't able to treat but we haven't found it yet.\" In lab tests, DRACO killed 15 viruses. It also saved the lives of mice given a dose of flu that would have killed them."

        "body": "MUMBAI: With no cure in sight for the dreaded HIV, scientists across the globe are working towards drugs to prolong the life-span of afflicted patients. An ongoing study by the KEM Hospital to find out the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs in improving the life expectancy of HIV positive patients has yielded some positive results. The medicine department of the hospital has been studying the potency of an ayurvedic drug on 700 HIV patients since April last year. After little more than a year, the institute found a significant boost in the count of CD4 cells in these patients, and also that it could probably push the initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), known to have many side-effects, by a few years. The count of CD4 cells is directly proportional to the health of a person for these cells are the most important part of one's immune system. Anyone with less CD4 count is more prone to ailments as the body's defence mechanism starts giving way. The ART for HIV patients is started only after the CD4 count falls below 250. After administering the ayurvedic drug, the doctors found that the CD4 count in patients on an average went up from 448 to 546 within six months and up to 590 in a year's time. Besides, many patients had weight gains, increase in haemoglobin count and a sense of well-being. Claiming that it spells a lot of promise, head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that not every patient who tests positive for HIV immediately qualifies for the ART drugs. \"Till a patient's CD4 count comes down to 250, we cannot prescribe ART. But patients show apprehension to go back home without medicines, especially after they are found positive for such a dreaded ailment,'' he said. Moreover, ART has side-effects like pain in abdomen, weakening of limbs and arms, swollen abdomen and distortion of facial features. Therefore, Pazare believes that patients could be prescribed some ayurvedic drugs with immuno-restorative properties that can delay the initiation of ART. \"Our assumption is that ayurvedic drugs with properties to strengthen immunity can delay the ART therapy by at least four years,'' said Pazare. \"And later, as the patient is put on ART, he can survive for a few more decades,'' he added. The KEM hospital study will be on for the next five years. However, the study solely focused on CD4 cells and did not check if the drug could bring down the viral load in a patient. Another hitch remains that ayurvedic drugs cannot be consumed simultaneously with the ART drugs. Speaking on the use of alternative therapies, head of ART department of JJ Hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande said nations across the globe were looking for indigenous medicines for HIV. \"Even in India, more systematic studies are required as there is no standardised data that talks about long-term effects,'' she said. Yet, she added that it may not be a bad idea to put patients on ayurvedic medicines with proven benefits till they are ideal candidates for ART."

The victim's sister had alleged that they were unnecessarily being harassed and asked to go from one office to another to take the body. \"The forensic team told us as well as the SDM, who was in the GMC morgue to conduct investigations, that since my brother had died of AIDS, they wouldn't like to perform the postmortem as it would prove to risky for their lives too,\" alleged his sister. The NGOs demanded that since the family members did not suspect any foul play, the body should be released so that they can perform the last rites of the body. \"The family even gave an affidavit to the SDM stating that we have no objection to the body being released without a postmortem. However, instead of releasing the body, the SDM said that he has sent their affidavit to the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi and the family would have to wait for NHRC's reply,\" alleged activist Albertina Almeida ."

Meanwhile, Percept is keen on doing the AIDS film with Aamir Khan, who has shown an interest in the film as well. Akshay on the other hand is not only willing to work immediately on the film but is also willing to produce it.\" According to the friend, while the director is highly excited about working with Aamir Khan for the first time, declining Akshay's offer to be part of the project is not an easy option. \"Akshay is a very close friend. He is also Priyan's family now since Priyan's assistant Abhilash Nair is married to Akshay's cousin. More than that, Priyan and Akshay go back a long way professionally,\" explained the friend. However with Percept, the film's current producers sold on the idea of having Aamir in the film.

        "body": "MUMBAI: Mahesh*, 41, a resident of Sangli, has lived with HIV for 14 years now. The last one year though has been the most trying. \u201cI have been hospitalised nine times over the last 11 months for chest and throat infections. I spent over Rs 3lakh in Pune and Mumbai hospitals before someone pointed out that my HIV drugs were not working. A doctor in the private sector offered to treat me for Rs 4lakh but there was no way I could afford that,\u201d said the patient. Mahesh\u2019s case is rare, but not unusual. In the battle against HIV-AIDS, some have developed resistance to most combinations of drugs used in treatment, either due to poor adherence to the regimen or mutation in the virus. For several such second-line failure patients, their only hope was the international NGO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, but that again was an option open to a select few. Now finally, a third, more potent line of treatment has finally been rolled out across 10 hospitals in India, including JJ in Mumbai, Maulana Azad in Delhi, others in Kolkata, Chennai, etc. 18 patients from Maharashtra have been enrolled for this higher grade of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is at least 15 times more expensive than the first-line treatment. The Byculla JJ facility, the nodal centre for HIV treatment in the state, has begun the exercise of screening 2,214 patients who are currently on second-line drugs. Doctors will look for a rapidly swelling viral load in them before concluding that the existing treatment regime is no longer effective to suppress the virus. \u201cAny patient with a viral load of above 10,000 copies/mL will immediately be started on the third-line which will be a combination of Raltegravir (400mg) , Darunavir (600mg) and Ritonavir (100mg),\u201d said Dr Vidya Nagar, nodal officer at JJ. The news that the state-run healthcare network is making available a third and more potent line of drugs has come as a huge relief. \u201cThe cost for third-line is at least 15 times more expensive than the first and five to six times more than the second line. Several patients have died only because they could not afford the treatment,\u201d said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. Many were even taking the drugs from the private sector but could not sustain for long. Additional project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, Dr Shrikala Acharya, said the annual cost of the third-line regimen was around Rs 1.5lakh for each patient. Drug resistance is one of the challenges for the HIV/AIDS programme. According to studies, resistance is less than 1% in first-line and 2-3% in the second-line. \u201cWe have detected around 60-70 resistant patients across India so far against our estimation of 500. But we have drugs for more than 1,000 patients and we can procure more,\u201d said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer, National Aids Control Organisation. Adult HIV prevalence at the national level has seen a decline from an estimated 0.38% in 2001-03 to 0.26% in 2015. Rise in new infections however has been a major point of concern. In 2015, over 86,000 new infections were detected across India. Resistance poses an additional challenge as treatment failure translates into a high viral load in patients. (Name of patient changed)"

But on Sunday, she issued a statement, sending it to South African newspaper The Star and US broadcaster ABCNews, apologizing. \u201cWords cannot express how sorry I am, and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of South Africa, who I have offended due to a needless and careless tweet,\u201d she wrote. After the controversy erupted, Sacco\u2019s employer issued a statement announcing that they had \u201cparted ways\u201d with her. Sacco\u2019s \u201coffensive comment does not reflect the views and values of IAC,\u201d the company said. Many Twitter users pointed to the ironic fact that Sacco worked in public relations for an Internet company. David Cohn wrote: \u201cIs that tweet real? You work in PR. You shld know better\u201d. The tweet isn\u2019t the latest in a string controversial comments Sacco has made on the site. Hours before, she had called London the home of \u201ccucumber sandwiches\u201d and \u201cbad teeth\u201d. In January, Sacco tweeted, \u201cI can\u2019t be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?\u201d The tweet sent by Justine Sacco, the then director of corporate communications at IAC, read: \u201cGoing to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get AIDS. Just kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d"

        "body": "BENGALURU : A 47-year-old HIV positive man from Chintamani in Chikkaballapur district was allegedly denied treatment by the governmentrun Institute of Nephro Urology (INU) in Victoria Hospital campus. However, the hospital has dismissed allegations of discrimination. For the past three years, the man has been undergoing treatment in Bengaluru to avoid the stigma he might face in his native town. Earlier this year, he was diagnosed with renal failure and was put on dialysis at INU in May 2018. However in July, he was told to seek treatment at his native place or in any other hospital. He was a construction labourer and as he\u2019s suffering from tuberculosis and kidney disorder, he\u2019s unable to work now. His homemaker wife is also an HIV patient. Their only son is pursuing graduation in Chintamani. His wife told STOI they\u2019re facing discrimination everywhere. \u201cI approached the government hospital in Chintamani also, but considering his HIV status, they said as it\u2019s a high-risk case he needed a separate machine for dialysis However, doctors claimed all patients who come to INU are initially treated here as it\u2019s a peripheral centre. Later, they are advised to go back to their native places for further treatment as these facilities are available in all districts now. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of discrimination. I will look into the issue,\u201d said institute director Dr Shivalingaiah. He said over 80 patients undergo dialysis every day and had to be taken to INU only. We went to INU last week, but the hospital is not treating him,\u201d she alleged. She said from May to July, he was put on dialysis thrice a week. But it stopped since July. When his condition worsened a week ago, INU refused treatment. The family tried its luck with other government hospitals in Bengaluru, but was turned away on the grounds that he required a special machine for dialysis."

        "title": "3rd line of defence against HIV in place for patients in India",
        "body": "Mahesh*, 41, a resident of Sangli, has lived with HIV for 14 years now. The last one year though has been the most trying. \"I have been hospitalised nine times over the last 11 months for chest and throat infections. I spent over Rs 3 lakh in Pune and Mumbai hospitals before someone pointed out that my HIV drugs were not working. A doctor in the private sector offered to treat me for Rs 4lakh but there was no way I could afford that,\" said the patient. Mahesh's case is rare, but not unusual. In the battle against HIV/AIDS, some have developed resistance to most combinations of drugs used in treatment, either due to poor adherence to the regimen or mutation in the virus. For several such second-line failure patients, their only hope was the international NGO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, but that again was an option open to a select few. Now finally, a third, more potent line of treatment has finally been rolled out across 10 hospitals in India, including JJ in Mumbai, Maulana Azad in Delhi, others in Kolkata, Chennai, etc. 18 patients from Maharashtra have been enrolled for this higher grade of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), which is at least 15 times more expensive than the firstline treatment. The Byculla JJ facility, the nodal centre for HIV treatment in the state, has begun the exercise of screening 2,214 patients who are currently on second-line drugs. Doctors will look for a rapidly swelling viral load in them before concluding that the existing treatment regime is no longer effective to suppress the virus. \"Any patient with a viral load of above 10,000 copiesmL will immediately be started on the third-line which will be a combination of Raltegravir (400mg), Darunavir (600mg) and Ritonavir (100mg),\" said Dr Vidya Nagar, nodal officer at JJ Hospital. The news that the state-run healthcare network is making available a third and more potent line of drugs has come as a huge relief. \"The cost for third-line is at least 15 times more expensive than the first and five to six times more than the second line. Several patients have died only because they could not afford the treatment,\" said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. Many were even taking the drugs from the private sector but could not sustain for long. Additional project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, Dr Shrikala Acharya, said the annual cost of the third-line regimen was around Rs 1.5 lakh for each patient. Drug resistance is one of the challenges for the HIV/AIDS programme. According to studies, resistance is less than 1% in first-line and 2-3% in the second-line. \"We have detected around 60-70 resistant patients across India so far against our estimation of 500. But we have drugs for more than 1,000 patients and we can procure more,\" said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer, National Aids Control Organisation. Adult HIV prevalence at the national level has seen a decline from an estimated 0.38% in 2001-03 to 0.26% in 2015. Rise in new infections however has been a major point of concern. In 2015, over 86,000 new infections were detected across India. Resistance poses an additional challenge as treatment failure translates into a high viral load in patients."

        "body": "MUMBAI: The red ribbon that was an integral part of the Maharashtra District Aids Control Society (MDACS) logo, one which is always associated with HIV, has now been changed to the fist of Shakti (Power). MCADS decided to go in for a makeover to improve its recall among Mumbaikars. Its Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) will now be called 'Shakti Clinic- HIV/AIDS Salah Kendra'. By the end of this month, there will be more Shakti clinics than railway stations in the city, said MDACS officials. \"About 5% of those who visit ICTCs for counseling test positive for HIV. There is either low awareness or fear of testing positive that keeps people from approaching our centres. We want to tell people that there is nothing to be afraid of and the only way of preventing HIV is to be aware,\" said Dr Harish Pathak, additional project director of MDACS. Hundreds of clinics will be operational across Mumbai within a month with a revamped look and feel to remove the fear of testing and increase recognition and recall among Mumbaikars. The decision follows a survey conducted by MDACS that covered population from slums and non slum areas, pregnant women from public and private sectors, bridge population like truckers and migrants and high-risk groups like sex workers. The survey revealed that though 82% of the respondents had heard about HIV/AIDS testing, more than 75% of this 82% were not aware of ICTCs. \"The survey revealed that there was low awareness about ICTCs due to their technical name. Hence we decided to change the image of ICTCs and create a brand with a name that the people would be able to identify. Hence we decided to rename ICTCs to Shakti Clinic- HIV/AIDS Salah Kendra,\" Dr Pathak said. The brand logo was created keeping in mind that it should be religion neutral considering the cultural melting pot that. \"Our logo, the internationally recognized red ribbon of AIDS awareness, has been transformed to a red ribbon that curls up into a fist, symbolizing strength,\" said Vinitha Venkat, joint director at MDACS. The strength of accessibility of information and services in the name itself is a step forward in reducing the stigma and being approachable. \"The new identity builds an ambience of care, positivity, trust and friendliness making it easy to access information on HIV/AIDs and increase the number of patients undergoing tests. It will also encourage a behavioral change towards Counseling and testing"

        "body": "MADURAI: The absence of a chief medical officer (CMO) at the voluntary counselling and testing centre at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) is causing unnecessary delay in providing immediate results for HIV patients. Due to this, the follow-up and treatment for the newly-detected HIV patients is also at stake. Officials of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) fume over the unnecessary delay in announcing the HIV test results, which make them to run from pillar to post in search of the patients who test positive. They say that every month around 10 to 15 HIV positive patients tested at the VCTC could not be traced from a total of around 45 positive cases. Although the time needed for the preliminary test is only a couple of minutes, it takes one day's time to announce the results due to the absence of a CMO, who is the authority to approve the test result. Sources from Tansacs say that an estimated 120 HIV positive cases go untraced every year due to this delay. They do not return the next day to receive the results mainly due to fear. If the results are furnished instantly they can be counselled and treated, they add since the anti-retroviral therapy centre to treat the patients is available inside the same building. \"While there are already 4,550 HIV positive patients in Madurai district under treatment, the Tansacs officials are concerned about the growing number of untraced HIV patients in the district. The untraced HIV patients pose threat of spreading the disease swiftly,\" say sources. At present, one of the professors from the department of microbiology is in-charge of the VCTC. However, she cannot stay at the centre since she has to engage in classes at the medical college. Sources from Tansacs, however, urged to depute an assistant or postgraduate medical student for the test confirmation. When contacted, M Kalirajan, district programme manager for Prevention and Control of HIV-AIDS, Madurai said, \"We are aware of the problem and have taken the issue to our higher officials and waiting for action. The problem is there in the centre for the last two years. We have also urged the hospital authorities to bring an end to the problem,\" he said. When contacted, authorities of the Madurai Medical College said that they have received complaints from Tansacs officials and are looking into the issue."

        "body": "AHMEDABAD: His two generations have battled the dreaded HIV virus. His grandmother got HIV through blood transfusion in 1980s but at that time, its treatment was a rarity she could hardly afford. His father was born with HIV and spent most of his childhood in hospitals. Dev who was born on May 10, 2013 is now all set to shed the curse of his inheritance as doctors predict that the child will be HIV negative. \"The advance test for HIV will be carried out once he stops breastfeeding at six months. In all likelihood, the child is going to be HIV negative as his mother was on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) and her CD4 count, which is the indicator of her immunity, was very good. While the test will tell for sure, the child is expected to beat the odds\", says Dr Rakesh Sharma, pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases. His father, Ankit Soni has faith that the child will be HIV negative. Soni has been determined to beat his illness, despite having suffered throughout his childhood. \"My mother had got herpes that did not heal. Finally, she tested positive for HIV but in those times, monthly cost of medicines was Rs 25,000. My father was a driver and he could not afford the treatment. My mother died when I was nine\", recalls Ankit. Ankit knew right from his childhood that he was HIV positive. He says that he never hid this fact and people have always treated him well. \"I am fortunate. When I read about 30 girls in Rajkot being prevented from attending school, I feel sorry because my principal had always supported me. My friends too have always stood by my side\", says Soni. Soni studied till class 8 but later dropped out when constant fever, vomiting, TB and other infections kept him in and out of hospitals for six long years. \"In 2006, I was put on free ART medication by Civil Hospital and have been healthy ever since. During these treatments, Soni met Falguni, an HIV positive girl and fell in love. Soni also has her name tattooed on his arms. While planning the baby, the couple ensured that their CD4 count was high enough, so that the HIV virus was not passed on to the child. Soni works as a photographer and supplements his income by running an autorickshaw. He hopes that the doctor's words come true as he wants a healthy baby and also hopes to put an end to his father's sufferings. \"He has dedicated his entire life looking after me. Now I want him to be relieved and happy\", he says. \"The child will be exclusively breastfed for five-odd months and a month later, the HIV test will be carried out\", says Dr Sharma."

The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur's Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state's oldest institution caring for children with HIV, suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India's 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out."

An erratic drug supply of second-line medication has forced thousands of patients\u2014some from as far as Nagpur, Sindhudurg, Akola and even parts of Gujarat\u2014to frequent the treatment centre multiple times a week to collect the drugs instead of the usual once-a-month practice. \u201cMost HIV-positive people hide their status at their workplace. We cannot afford to seek leave every alternate day to collect the medicines. Several people have lost their jobs because of this,\u201d said an HIV patient, adding that lately he has been asking for leave once every week. The Bhayander resident said he has already switched jobs twice as too many questions about his absenteeism were raised at the workplace. Another HIV-positive patient, a 37-year-old Sion resident, said he has been missing doses as his boss has started questioning his medical fitness. \u201cHow many leaves can an office grant in a week? We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,\u201d he complained. Patients are livid that while other four ART centres\u2014in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli\u2014have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months. The only centre to disburse second-line medicines in city, it also caters to patients from Konkan region. An official from the state Aids control society said the hospital has recently purchased second-line medicines worth Rs16 lakh, but the patients rejected the claim. Nearly 2,400 patients are on second-line HIV treatment in the state, of which about 900 come to JJ Hospital. \u201cWe wrote to the Mumbai District Aids Control Society asking for three months\u2019 supply of drugs, but did not get any response,\u201d said Dr VK Joglekar in-charge of the ART centre, JJ Hospital. \u201cThe problem will be resolved within a month. We have placed the orders. Tenders were floated earlier but there were no bidders,\u201d said Dr BB Rewari, head of ART at National Aids Control Organisation. A member of CHIRAG, an action group of HIV+ people, alleged that at least two HIV-infected patients died last year due to the delay in moving them from first- to second- line of treatment. One was a 37-year-old woman who was admitted to JJ for three months, only to be told that her viral load was too high for the second-line medication to work. \u201cShe died within days,\u201d said a worker from the group."

Prevention of Parent to Children Transmission Programme has yielded good results. The government introduced free bus travel for HIV positive patients three months ago. Once in a month, the dependents of those below 18 and above 60 can also travel free in buses to ART centres to buy medicines. In the past three years, the HIV positive cases have come down in both pregnant women and the public. Among 75,424 tested pregnant women, 457 tested positive in the period April 2009 to March 2010 while in April 2010 to March 2011, among 73,118 women tested, 312 cases were found positive. In the period April 2011 to March 2012, 1,23,857 women underwent HIV test, and 262 were found positive while during April 2012 to February 2013, 82,613 were tested and 167 found positive. Among general public, from April 2011 to March 2012, among 1,02,493 people, 4,453 tested positive while from April 2012 to February 2013, of the 91,154 people who underwent test, 3,135 were found positive. Dr Balakrishna N Tukkar of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, Belgaum district, said: \"Thanks to awareness, pregnant women come voluntarily for the test now, which was not the case six to seven years back. With the help of central and state governments and with the support from NGOs, we conducted various awareness programmes like street plays, counselling of sex workers and competitions in schools and colleges. Once the patients are tested HIV positive, we conduct pre- and post- counselling. There are five ART centres in Belgaum district, each in Belgaum, Savadatti, Chikkodi, Athani and Gokak taluk. Patiensts are given free tablets at these centres.'' He added: \"After the government launched the Parent to Children Transmission Programme in 2006, the number of children succumbing to HIV positive due to mother has come down drastically. Under this programme, anti-retroviral tablets are given to pregnant women who are tested HIV positive from their fourth month of pregnancy. Through this, even if a mother is HIV positive, the baby will not get it.'' The NGOs also play a pivotal role. They keep track of the patients. If they discontinue tablets, they counsel them and get them to ART Centre and give the tablets."

However, children with the disease often can\u2019t avail of them, mostly because there is no one to look after them and take them to the hospital. An organization run by an American has come to the rescue of more than 3,000 children living with HIV (CLHIV) from the city. Jerry Hughes from Minnesota, USA, has been coming to the city for the last 10 years to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS and inspire PLHIVs to be optimistic. Through the Hughes Foundation, he has also made considerable contributions to the lives of positive people in Namibia and India. Having shifted base to the city in December, after leaving a well paying job and a promising career in advertising, Jerry now plans to focus all his energies on helping HIV positive children and women of the region. \u201cFor ten years, I have been visiting Nagpur off and on to interact with PLHIVs and activists here. I felt like the place and the people were beckoning me to help and contribute in any way I could. It led to what I call \u2018India 10.0\u2019, a project in which we aim to change the face of AIDS in India. We have started with 17 orphans who are HIV positive,\u201d said Jerry, himself an HIV positive person. For two months now, an old, beat up car is being used to cater to the health needs of these and other kids with the infection. The organization also runs a pen pal programme for women suffering from the disease, where they write emails to students at Jerry\u2019s alma mater, the University of Minnesota. His ultimate goal is to start a centre that provides free treatment, counselling and creates awareness about the disease. The kids under the project have been provided for by a corporate group from the city while activist Samir Shinde has been looking after them for the past four years. \u201cThese are children who require special care in terms of health, nutrition, medication and developmental issues. They are also prone to becoming sick more often. Therefore, we also arrange a lot of fun activities \u2013 picnics, games, movie nights \u2013 to help their cognitive development,\u201d he said. These activities also help in lightening the burdened souls of the kids. \u201cHIV and people suffering from it often paint a dull, drab picture. Personally, I would like to give it a facelift, bringing in an element of hope and fun,\u201d said Jerry. This has already begun in the form of a 1930s Hollywood-style promotional video and \u2018scooter cam\u2019, a series of social experiment videos on topics like, \u2018Does mosquito bites cause HIV?\u2019 put up on the various social media platforms of the foundation."

Hospital staff maintains that despite being referred to Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Ram was staying the ward on his free will. Hospital administration is also unable to clarify as to why the patient, who is unable to travel on his own, has not been provided with the ambulance facility for shifting to SSL. Ram has a severe infection in his leg and is unable to move even from his bed. Forty-year-old Ram, who is being nursed by his old mother, says, \"We cannot go to SSL. We have no money or strength to travel.\" He had earlier alleged that hospital staff was discriminating against him in providing medical care. He had claimed that the para-medical staff had refused to clean his wound and dress it properly. As a result, her mother was acting as his nurse. The para-medics had claimed that Ram's case was different as he was suffering from HIV infection. \"HIV positive patients have to be attended in a different manner. We don't have any arrangement for taking care of such a patient, hence we are unable to take care of his wound,\" said para-medic Saikhu. The hospital's attitude towards Ram is indicative of the stigma and lack of awareness among the hospital staff regarding HIV. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has clear guidelines that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with general patients and without discrimination. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. The hospital's silence over not offering any assistance in shifting the patient to BHU is also a major issue. Meanwhile, taking serious note of the reports of discrimination against HIV positive patient, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sought a report from the Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) Divisional Hospital on the issue. Through a letter, the NACO has ordered officials concerned to probe into the matter and submit a report within a week. Accepting that such a letter has been received by the hospital administration, superintendent-in-chief (SIC), SPG Hospital, Dr VK Srivastava said, \"The patient is staying in the hospital on his own free will. He is not ready to shift to the BHU. We have already informed the CMO and the police about it. The hospital staff has never discriminated against the patient. We will submit a report to NACO by Friday.\" Meanwhile, the 'Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV' a non-profit organisation run by HIV positive people has also taken the matter seriously. According to Manoj Singh, president, BNPPL, they have filed a detailed report on the discrimination and neglect faced by Ram in the divisional hospital. \"By discharging and referring these two HIV patients, hospital only wants to unburden its load. The hospital lacks proper facilities and there is complete lack of coordination. We have filed a detailed report about these two patients and are sending it to Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS),\" said Manoj."

The project will step up research to understand the rural dynamics of the epidemic and through the NARRIM Clinic provide HIV testing, counselling and referral services by quality personnel. \u201cGrounded efforts to reach out to the people who need it the most will be done by significant outreach to the adjoining communities, consultations with local stakeholders, formation of local level advisory and regulatory bodies and conduct of formative assessments. These will help in mapping \u2018hot spots\u2019 and high risk populations in the area and facilitate better understanding of the rural nature of HIV epidemic. In the long run, expansion in other diseases of local interest is also envisaged.\u201d"

According to officials of the Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS), which conducts targeted intervention projects for high-risk groups, migrant labourers and more specifically men having sex with men (MSMs) among them is a category that has been completely neglected in the state. \u201cThey are a category that remains totally unchecked. We are yet to launch projects specifically targeting MSMs among the migrant labour community. They pose a serious risk of spreading HIV infection in the society as they have started to mingle with local people for money and sexual gratification,\u201d said KSACS (targeted intervention) joint director Dennis Joseph. Kochi has nearly 1,200 MSMs who are registered and covered under various projects of the KSACS. \u201cWe have programmes focusing on MSMs from the lower strata who need to be made aware of safe practices. But they don\u2019t include migrant labourers. Moreover, a large number of MSMs belong to the economically upward bracket and operate in a different platform compared to the lower strata,\u201d he said. While the audited figure is 1,200 for all categories of MSMs, the unofficial figure in the city is around 4,000 to 5,000, who come mostly from migrant labourers and the economically upward class, according to Joseph. City shadow police sub inspector Muhammed Nizar said that activities of MSMs, whether it is migrant labourers or locals, are increasing in the city. \u201cMoney is the main factor that is attracting MSMs to the city,\u201d said another police officer."

Children are the most vulnerable group, with such cases having increased by 46 per cent between 2001 and 2009, WHO said. \"The threat of HIV/AIDS to children highlights the need to strengthen health systems at the primary healthcare level and to integrate HIV-specific interventions within broader maternal and child health services,\" WHO regional director for Southeast Asia Samlee Plianbangchang said. Globally, an estimated 33.3 million people live with the virus, and 2.6 million were infected in 2009. About 2.3 million people live with AIDS in India. Regionally, women constitute 37 per cent of the 3.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Southeast Asia, and without any intervention, about a third of infants born to HIV-positive mothers could acquire the virus. \"The virus can be transmitted to an infant during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. However, only one in three HIV-positive women can currently access antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the Southeast Asian region,\" he said. Widespread implementation of WHO's new guidelines on the use of ART drugs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants could substantially reduce pediatric HIV and improve maternal and child survival, he added.

        "body": "IMPHAL: At least 17 inmates of Central Sajiwa Jail in Imphal East have tested HIV positive, forcing the authorities concerned and NGOs to step up their campaign to combat the menace. With hardly 0.2 per cent of India's population, Manipur contributes nearly 8 per cent of the country's total HIV cases. According to the latest epidemiological study of the Manipur State Aids Control Society (Macs), there are 38,016 HIV positive people and 10,109 are women and 2578 children. Besides, 9,985 are undergoing anti-retroviral therapy (ART). A doctor, who is in-charge of therapy and counseling of jail inmates under the project, said 38 blood samples were collected for testing after carrying out counseling of prisoners. He added that tattooing inside the jail has been banned following detection of the HIV positive cases. On World AIDS Day (December 1) last year, governor Gurbachan Jagat launched an AIDS intervention programme in Sajiwa jail following which counselling, testing and awareness camps have been introduced. The project has been taken up as a joint initiative of Macs, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNO-DC) and the jail authorities with Manipur Network of Positive People (MNP+) as the implementing agency, a source said. He added that about 600 inmates are in the jail. On Thursday, a joint team of officials, including Macs project director PK Jha , UNODC regional expert Gunasekhar and SP (Jail) Themthing visited Sajiwa jail to scrutinize the progress of the programme. Of the 17 inmates who have tested HIV positive, five are undergoing anti-retroviral therapy at the state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital here. The process is on for CD4 count of ten others. A source said all 17 inmates had unprotected sex prior to their entry to jail. Key functionaries of MNP+ said proper counselling of the inmates by psychiatrists is the need of the hour as majority of them are suffering from depression, anxiety and other mental health-related problems. The functionaries have been carrying out counselling in Sajiwa jail thrice a week. PK Jha said an ART link would be opened inside the jail shortly and training would be imparted to jail staff and security personnel. On Sunday, a constituency level convention on HIV/AIDS cum health camp was held in the remote Maram Bazaar in Senapati district."

Darshana Vyas, project director, Pathfinder International, said, \"The convention was held at Panhala (Kolhapur district) and was an attempt to re-energise the MSM community, strengthen community feeling and leverage greater leadership and involvement in project governance and implementation.\" She said that community-based organisations (CBOs) formed so far, have to gradually evolve into a state-level federation acting as a constant support to the community and giving voice to their issues. \"We not only need to ensure that the community is made part of the mainstream, but also continue and scale our efforts to reach the unreached.\" The convention was organised by Pathfinder International which has been implementing the Mukta project to reduce prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS among the most at risk populations such as female sex workers (FSW), MSMs and their partners. Now working in five districts of Maharashtra, the project seeks to transition the management and implementation of the HIV programme to CBOs. The convention held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from six districts of Maharashtra, namely Kolhapur, Latur, Nasik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal where CBOs have been formed. Various groups and institutions working with the MSM community such as Samabhavana Society, Samapathik and Udaan also attended the convention. The event included guided discussions on strengthening communication for behaviour change, raising awareness on human rights, entitlements and imparting micro-planning, leadership and team-building skills. Sameer Kumta, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that supports HIV prevention programmes in the districts, underlined the need for leadership from within the community and called upon the members to take ownership of the work and share responsibilities. \"It is only through collective efforts that we can address newer challenges, while contributing effectively towards bringing down the HIV prevalence rates,\" he said, adding that the convention was a platform to rethink the communication, leadership and management strategies for a stronger community-led HIV response. Kumar (name changed) a Kolhapur-based peer educator, said, \"Coming together proved helpful in understanding how we can collectively address issues such as adherence to ART, consistent condom use, diagnosis and treatment of STIs, voluntary HIV testing, etc. We hope to carry home learnings from this workshop and use it to reach out to the community at our level.\" In the session on legal literacy, participants were informed about rights of the community and applicable legal provisions. Raju, another MSM from Latur, while sharing his learning from the session, said there are some laws that criminalise sexual acts between members of the same sex. \"We must collectively challenge such laws and policies that abuse human rights and limit fundamental freedom,\" he said. Pathfinder International has facilitated FSW and MSM CBOs in Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal districts and has successfully handed over six district interventions to the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society as part of the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III). The project has been successful in decreasing STI rates among FSWs and MSM by over 30% in the last five years. The convention, Saptarang (Rainbow), held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Beed, Pune."

They appear like any other couple, yet theirs is no ordinary coupling. Having tested positive for HIV-contracted from different partners-some years ago, the 43-year-old Desmond and 38-year-old Catherine did not let AIDS tie their lives in knots. Instead, they tied the knot, and thanks to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) their child is HIV negative. For Melvin and Janet D'Souza, both also HIV positive, the tying of the knot happened 30 years ago. They chose not to have children. NGOs working towards enlightening society on the humane treatment of those with HIV say more and more people with AIDS in Goa are taking the plunge into marriage. \"Loneliness and lack of companionship often lead to neglect of one's health, so having a partner does create an environment for a better future and longer life,\" says Maria Cardoso, project officer at Udant. Anita Pereira, also with the NGO, says, \"Many who have HIV initially have doubts about getting married, but, HIV does not prevent anyone from marrying, it only requires a little more responsibility and trust from both people in the relationship.\" Medications, new infections, family issues and failing health burden HIV-positive couples everyday. Yet they stand by each other, fighting tough. Catherine, who contributes to the family income by selling vegetables she grows, says the couple has \"abundant worries\". \"We have short lives. And we have to think about the future of our child.\" Janet, who works at the insurance firm where Melvin worked, says, \"Most of the challenges we face are perceived, not real. We make choices based on these perceptions.\" Two of the choices for the D'Souzas have been not to have children-\"we didn't want to leave them orphaned\"-and not to buy a house-\"so the surviving partner would not be saddled with a mortgage\". \"I never thought long-term about changing my career. I am just happy we can support ourselves,\" says Janet. Pereira says many people with HIV nurse dreams of marriage and living normal lives, but since they are unable to meet like-minded people, their dreams remain unfulfilled. \"Moreover, having a sexual relationship with your partner can cause tremendous anxiety if you are HIV positive.\" She points out the contrast that people with other diseases and disabilities lead normal, healthy lives that include relationships and marriage. Ask Janet what advice she has for those with HIV getting into relationships, and pat comes the reply, \"I don't think my advice would be different for 'positive' or 'negative'.\" \"Honesty,\" she says, \"Is the most important thing you can bring to the table. And tolerance. And letting people grow at their own pace.\" There's also learning how to argue. \"If you're agitated, walk away, and don't come back to the subject until you've calmed down and can hear each other's point of view,\" says Janet. Melvin says it's important for couples to support each other in doing things they're passionate about. Also, \"toss aside the petty stuff and concentrate on what's important. When you are given a life sentence, you make sure every day counts\". Dipak Kabadi, director of the government-run Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says, \"There are half-a-dozen NGOs working to create awareness about HIV, and helping people living with the disease not to be stigmatized.\" Cardoso sums up the message when she says, \"Supporting persons living with HIV to get married and have a family is an encouragement to help them lead a normal life.\" (Couples' names changed to protect identities)"

Ambedkar Hospital has been working with high-risk groups, including sex workers, homosexuals and eunuchs, making them aware and also providing free tests and treatment. The hospital\u2019s clinic for such infections, known as Suraksha, is now in its fourth year, and has already helped 5,000-odd patients, with many of them belonging to high-risk groups. It was set up to provide counselling along with treatment and referrals. Recently, the hospital tied up with several city-based NGOs to identify more high-risk group patients and encourage them to come and get tested for reproductive tract infections (RTIs), STIs and for HIV. The response, says chief medical superintendent Meena Mishra, has been overwhelming. The hospital\u2019s records show that there has been an increase in the number of patients coming in for treatment voluntarily\u2014while initially, an average of 90 people would come for tests every month, recent records point to at least 200 people seeking treatment. According to the records, 244 and 223 people were tested for and sought treatment for RTIs, STIs and HIV in March and April this year, respectively. The patients are also provided free pre- and post-test counselling by the hospital\u2019s trained councillor. The Suraksha clinic also conducts awareness sessions on safe sex, personal hygiene, etc. \u201cPatients, particularly sex workers and eunuchs, don\u2019t realize the seriousness of contracting AIDS and think they are wasting time that could be spent more valuably by earning money. However, these tests save a lot of people from the misery of late diagnosis,\u201d said Rashmi Singh, the councillor at Suraksha clinic. \u201cOf late, more people have become aware. It seems the word-of-mouth advertisement of our programme has been effective, as more and more high-risk group patients come and take the tests voluntarily,\u201d she added. In case the report is positive for STIs or RTIs, the clinic offers them treatment, medicine kit and counselling for free. In case of those found HIV positive, the clinic provides them counselling and refers them to the Meerut district hospital. The identity of the patients visiting the clinic is kept secret."

However, from this week, USACS will provide free drugs to all 5,527 patients. In another welcome move, USACS has decided to help poor patients in getting subsidized food grains from district food offices. Also, the destitute will not have to endure long queues and will be helped by officials at ART centres. These officials will coordinate with district food officers for getting ID cards for the patients. Gagan Luthra, who is a project officer with USACS, said, \u201cBoth these initiatives are equally important. In majority of the cases, HIV positive patients are abandoned by their families. Some of the poor patients suffer from poverty and hunger which deteriorates their health. The food security provided to them will ensure that they do not suffer due to hunger.\u201d HIV positive patients in the state have been demanding food and travel subsidy for a long time. One of their primary demands is that of travel pass. \u201cWe often miss out on medication as we are unable to travel to other parts of the city or the state for check-ups. Most of the times, we don\u2019t have the money to travel and hence a travel pass is very important for us,\u201d said an HIV positive patient from Dehradun."

        "body": "Bengaluru: A recent survey conducted by the Sex Workers Study Committee has revealed that HIV-infected children are accepted only at five of the 57 government-run children homes. Activists allege that 91% of these centres have closed their doors to children, who test positive for HIV. The committee embarked on the survey following an incident in Hassan, where a 13-year-old girl with HIV was refused admission to a state-run-home. In all, there are eight HIV-infected children housed across five state-run homes \u2013 Bengaluru, Ramanagara, Dharwad, Raichur and Vijayanagar. Child rights activist Roopa Hassan, who was part of the study committee, highlighted the glaring discrepancy between the actual capacity of these homes and their strength. \u201cThey can actually house 70 to 200 children, but they accommodate 30 to 50 at the most. The remaining seats remain vacant, while officials continue to get a steady flow of money for the total capacity from the government. They continue to refuse children despite the available room to house more,\u201d she said. On schools refusing admission to children infected with HIV, she said, \u201cIt is because of social stigma and taboo.\u201d She alleged that officials at the centres also told kids not to sit beside those with HIV, or to socialise with them. Lamenting the discriminatory practices in government institutions, she said, \u201cThe government should take the first step towards eliminating discrimination towards those with HIV, by increasing awareness among people that it is a non-communicable disease.\u201d Sources said that the officials in charge of the homes, moved HIV-infected children to other NGOs after they had been admitted, but kept their names on the register to ensure the funds did not dry up. Thoracic surgeon and director of SDS Tuberculosis Research Centre and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi said, \u201cChildren homes were set up to rescue infected children, provide them adequate treatment and shield them from discrimination. However, reality works the other way round. Lack of accountability and a scrutinising system are the major problems. Although the government invests money and manpower into the cause, there is nobody keeping track of how they are used.\u201d Adding that the homes were required to admit HIV-infected children, Dr Buggi said, \u201cThey should send them to integrated counselling and testing centres to screen for other co-infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, bacterial and viral infections. They should be made to undergo CD4 (a glycoprotein in immune cells) count tests to know the status of body immunity on a daily basis.\u201d He said that people too had a responsibility to see that the government was spending the money earmarked for protection and care of HIV-infected children efficiently. District child protection officer (DCPO) at the Bengaluru urban child welfare committee, Divya Narayanappa said that no case of a HIV-infected child being refused admission had been officially reported. \u201cThere is one such home in the city, Bangalore Shishu Mangal, and no such case has been reported here. The home has admitted a HIV-infected boy. The efficiency and competence levels of district officers has increased since the formation of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme,\u201d she said. She did, however point out that in some cases wherein children were shifted from state-run homes since they might require special care and intervention. \u201cThere are instances when their health condition reaches a point beyond control that they need personal care, and they are moved to NGO-run centres, which exclusively provide for HIV children,\u201d she added. But, she said that any instance of discrimination, or attitude, was wrong, and needed to be brought to the notice of authorities.

        "body": "BENGALURU: In what could be a game changer in treating HIV patients, the National AIDS Control Organization (Naco) has decided that all patients registered for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will undergo viral load testing. It will measure the quantity of HIV virus in patients and help doctors decide their treatment regime. Hitherto, the test was conducted only after the first line of drugs failed, which would happen after 5-7 years of patients being diagnosed with HIV, and result in them losing golden time in starting new medicines. On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS). A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres. While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don\u2019t visit the centres. The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment. \u201cThe cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,\u201d said an officer from KSAPS. This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through M/s Metropolis Healthcare Limited under a public-private partnership (PPP) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner. \u201cCurrently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,\u201d a senior officer in KSAPS said. Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. \u201cFor patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient\u2019s initiation on ART,\u201d said KSAPS officers. However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government\u2019s partnership with a private entity. \u201cThere is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,\u201d said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV. HIV positive people on active ART care Adult males: 69,376 Adult females: 84,409 Transgenders, Transsexuals: 373 Male children: 6,443 Female children: 5,316 Total: 1,65,917 Source: KSAPS (figures as on Dec 2017)"

Kavya's medical status has baffled doctors as neither of her parents have HIV. She was transfused blood twice between December 2012 and February this year at a private nursing home in Kothapet, Guntur, but the donors, one being her father, had tested negative for HIV/AIDS. After the blood transfusion in February this year, investigations done at the same nursing home revealed that she was HIV positive. Subsequently, Kavya's parents suspected that the nursing home transfused HIV infected blood and lodged a complaint with the police. But with doubts rising over whether the couple claiming to be her parents are the biological parents or not, a paternity test is also being done at a Hyderabad-based centre and the results are awaited. On Tuesday, authorities at Government General Hospital, Guntur, wrote a letter to the district collector to make arrangements for shifting the girl to Niloufer Hospital. Hospital authorities said that Kavya is losing weight rapidly and needs a better treatment facility. \"Her weight at the time of admission a couple of months ago was 6.8 kg and has now reduced to 5.5 kg,\" said a doctor. While doctors said that she is being treated for HIV with anti retroviral therapy being initiated recently, there is little or no improvement in her condition. \"The district authorities will have to arrange an ambulance to shift her. Her prognosis continues to be guarded,\" the doctor added."

About 55 gays, ranging from post-graduate students to sex workers, were interviewed in a study conducted by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in collaboration with Sahodaran (an NGO for MSMs). Though the study says that gay men in India have an HIV seroprevalence rate that is 22 times higher than the country\u2019s general population, those surveyed have a different take. \u201cIt is better not to keep concentrating on HIV\u2026 I think it is important to raise the low self-esteem of MSMs,\u201d one of the interviewees said.

The interviewees also pointed out lack of privacy in state-run STI clinics (health centres which deal with sexually transmitted diseases). Once their sexual identity is disclosed, the homosexuals often face discrimination and harassment. This, some stated, forced them into alcohol or substance abuse. As a remedy, most stated that they preferred individual counseling. \u201cWhen the society ridicules, having multiple partners becomes a desirable way to feel accepted. Unless they get help to come to terms and respect themselves, the sexual risk they face cannot be addressed. We have disseminated this study to NACO and few NGOs to carry out counseling,\u201d said scientist Beena Thomas, NIRT."

Former president of Mangalore Bar Association SP Changappa said that the cell will extend help to solve various problems people in these groups face. \"There are more than 3,000 laws in India, but there is no specific law that protects HIV positive people, transgenders and sex workers. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice had drafted HIV/Aids Bill in 2007, but the President has not given assent to it so far. Most of the problems HIV positive people, transgenders and sex workers face will be solved if the Bill is enacted,\" Changappa said. There are several instances of parents abandoning children after they were diagnosed as HIV positive. Some parents even deny property rights even though children have the right. Similarly, transgenders and sex workers too are being treated shabbily in the society. All such inequalities can be eradicated through the proposed Act, he added.

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Come October, migrants, believed to be fuelling India's HIV epidemic, will get a quick crash course on safe sex and dangers of risky sexual behaviour, just before they board their train to large towns and cities in search of work. In what will be one of the most ambitious interventions to combat HIV, the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has identified 68 main railway stations in districts across 11 states from where migrants usually board long distance trains. Studies on the relation between migration and HIV conducted recently by Naco in three popular migration corridors \u2014 Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai \u2014 threw up shocking findings. The highest burden of HIV was found to be among migrants, after the high risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men. The studies have shown that two to four times more number of informal workers have non-regular partners or visit sex workers with only 25% using condoms compared to 42% by others. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average. What's worse, the total number of migrants continue to increase in India. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population in 2001 was considered to have migrated (314 million of the total 1,028 million people), which shows a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. Naco, which has now asked the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria to grant $50 million for the targeted intervention on migrants, says, \"In India, there is increasing evidence and growing recognition of the importance of migration in the spread of HIV infection. Naco has, therefore, revised its migrant strategy and decided to identify high outmigration locations at source, transit and destination, providing them information about HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections and safe migration.\""

The machine has been malfunctioning since November 2016 and though it was repaired last week it stopped functioning three days later. HIV patients who are likely in need of ART are administered a CD4 test to count their viral load. Currently, persons living with HIV are given ART on the basis of clinical analysis without checking viral load. CD4 cells play a major role in protecting the body from infection. However, Dr Jose D\u2019Sa, project director Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), said the machine was repaired last week and it\u2019s functioning. \u201cIt is in working condition,\u201d D\u2019Sa said. Raj Vaidya, treasurer Positive People, said they have been sending people to GMC, and they have been told that machine had developed a fault. \u201cLast week, we (representative of NGOs) had complained to the project director, GSACS about the non-functioning of the machine, and it was repaired, but stopped working two days later,\u201d Vaidya said. Vaidya said the decade old machine has to be replaced with new one. The Goa State NGO forum on HIV/AIDS met last week to discuss the issue in detail with inputs from the member organization. \u201cIf no solution is arrived at by end of January, the forum felt that the matter should be reported to Goa State Human Rights Commission,\u201d said Vaidya. The forum felt that the there is an urgent need for a brand new machine to avoid the recurrence of breakdown and to reduce pressure on the current CD4 machine. He was of the view that a proposal should be sent to the state government. Close to 7,000 patients are registered with ART center. ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines which prevents HIV from multiplying and destroying infection-fighting CD4 cells. Those with low or rapidly falling CD 4 counts are put on the ART treatment."

In addition, the scientists from California Institute of Technology demonstrated that a particular antibody to gp120 makes contact not only with the protein, but with CD4 receptor that gp120 uses to gain entrance into the body's T cells. This three-dimensional understanding of how gp120 is built is more than just a basic scientific advance, they say. \"There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120. Having more structural information will facilitate better vaccine design,\" said lead scientist Ron Diskin. The team looked specifically at gp120 from what is known as clade C HIV-1. To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades. Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is \"the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,\" said Diskin. \"It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide.\" In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true \u2014 the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c."

State government officials and the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) are tight-lipped about the co-infection case. A source said: \u201cThe patient is yet to be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Such patients are usually treated for TB at the beginning. Once they stabilize, ART is started.\u201d TB is the commonest HIV-related opportunistic infection. An expert summed up the deadly nature of the combined infection saying that when HIV brings down immunity, TB catches up. \u201cThe two need to be dealt with in a synchronized manner. Efforts and the machinery to integrate the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) with the HIV programme need to be strengthened.\u201d As per norm, patients received by registered TB centres are counselled to go for HIV testing and vice versa. Since HIV testing is voluntary, many give it a miss. Doctors say TB patients are often not counselled enough to understand the importance of HIV testing. According to data compiled by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), out of 1.01 lakh registered TB patients, only 40,202, or 39%, were referred to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV testing in 2011 till September. Among them, 1,678 patients tested positive for HIV. In Mumbai, the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is 7-8%. Dr S S Kudalkar of MDACS said mortality among patients suffering from both infections has halved in recent years. \u201cTill a few years ago, the mortality rate (among HIV-TB co-infection patients) was around 8%. Now it is 4%.\u201d He said HIV patients with TB \u201cprobably have a higher risk of recurrence and death\u201d. \u201cAt no point can these patients afford to discontinue their treatments as that could give rise to (drug) resistance.\u201d A chest specialist said HIV clubbed with resistant TB may be tricky, but not impossible to manage. \u201cYes, drug interactions (in such a patient) can have more side effects, but it can be handled if the patient comes in at an early stage.\u201d"

The total number of pregnant women who deliver in the state each year is 21 lakh. The state says achieving HIV testing for 100% of pregnant woman is a distant possibility. This is because over 1,150 primary health centres and sub-centres still do not have any testing facilities. Such centres witness 7 lakh deliveries, but manage to test only about 50,000 women.

It is because of this migrating population that the women and children too face the risk of turning HIV positive. Though Jaisalmer is a low-risk area for now, the increase in number of HIV positive and AIDS cases has become a major concern for the district. According to experts, thousands of labourers travel to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and others, mainly for work. \"These laboureres spend months in big cities and often are involved in unsafe sex and and carry back the virus with them,'' said Jugna Swami, who works with the high-risk groups in the district. She claimed the situation has deteriorated in the past four or five years. \"It's because of these migrants that women and children too are getting infected,\" Jugna claimed. She adds after the migrants, it is the sex-workers in the district who fall in the high-risk group. \"It is not uncommon for housewives in the slum areas of Jaisalmer to have multiple partners and a number of them are involved in prostitution as well,'' she said. Volunteers working on the AIDS programme in the district regularly visit the high-risk groups, couselling them and ensuring they agree to a full medical check-up every three months. A recent survey conducted by NACO estimated the number of sex-workers in Jaisalmer town alone to be about 1,500. This apart, a 2009 survey revealed that 1,140 camel owners in the district were involved in prostitution. Jugna's NGO distributes over 70,000 condoms to the high-risk groups every month. Jaisalmer town alone has 19 condom-distributing depos. Two dispensing boxes have been fitted in Sam specially for the tourists and the camel riders. \"Reports suggest that even foreign tourists are involved with the camel riders, specially when they opt for long camel safaris in the desert. Over the past two years, special efforts have been made to counsel the camel-riders. Though, in most cases, foreign tourists are known to play safe and take all precautions,'' admitted Jugna."

However, this change is so gradual that it is unlikely to have an impact on vaccine design, researchers said. \"Much research has focused on how HIV adapts to antiviral drugs \u2014 we wanted to investigate how HIV adapts to us, its human hosts, over time,\" said lead author Zabrina Brumme, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University. \"HIV adapts to the immune response in reproducible ways. In theory, this could be bad news for host immunity \u2014 and vaccines \u2014 if such mutations were to spread in the population,\" said Brumme. \"Just like transmitted drug resistance can compromise treatment success, transmitted immune escape mutations could erode our ability to naturally fight HIV,\" said Brumme. Researchers characterised the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequences from patients dating from 1979, the beginning of the North American HIV epidemic, to the modern day. The team reconstructed the epidemic's ancestral HIV sequence and from there, assessed the spread of immune escape mutations in the population. \"Overall, our results show that the virus is adapting very slowly in North America. In parts of the world harder hit by HIV though, rates of adaptation could be higher,\" said Brumme. \"We already have the tools to curb HIV in the form of treatment \u2014 and we continue to advance towards a vaccine and a cure. Together, we can stop HIV/AIDS before the virus subverts host immunity through population-level adaptation,\" Brumme added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics."

Richa is just 18 and had been diagnosed with HIV positive. And like Richa, several youngsters in their adolescence had been diagnosed with HIV in the last one and a half years. According to the data available with the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) Centre in civil hospital, about 500 patients aged 15 and 24 years, under the category of adolescents, have been admitted since the last one-and-a-half years. According to the present report, there are 3,700 patients being treated at the ART centre in Ludhiana, out of which 500 are adolescents between the age group of 15 and 24. Two major hospitals- Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and Christian Medical College and Hospital in the city also report their HIV positive cases to the ART centre. These numbers have varied during the last four year since the ART centre was launched on December 17, 2009. Initially, the ART centre used to receive about 10-20 cases of adolescents over the years. But now the figures have increased and the centre currently treats 500 registered cases. Talking about the tremendously increasing figures of HIV positive among the adolescents in last four years in city centre, Gurjit Singh, SMO, ART centre, said, \"At present, around 500 cases of HIV positive in adolescents are being treated here. According to data, there are two major reasons that have been found to be the reason behind the disease a?? the first being drug abuse and the second being unprotected sex or sex with more than one partner.\" According to experts, an overview of the data reveals that out of the 3,700 HIV cases being treated, 87% are cases of sexual infection, 5-10% of drug abuse, and others due to infection from mother to child and blood transfusion. In case of adolescents, 70% cases happen due to sexual activity and rest due to drug abuse. Vikas Garg, assistant professor medicine from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said, \"We receive about 10-20 HIV patients every month, of which adolescents make up for the major number of confirmed cases. The reason behind the increase in these cases is that even after widespread awareness about HIV/AIDS, people do not take it seriously. Drug abuse as the major reason in city had been spreading fast among the adolescents. They mainly get affected by sharing the used syringes, which many a times may be infected. And as the infected person is more prone to opportunistic infections, it leads to other diseases.\" Talking about the root cause of cases, Navjot Singh, professor and unit head department of medicine, CMC, said, \"There is only one way to cure this problem, which is by starting treatment as soon as it is diagnosed. Although, an HIV positive person is mostly left with little time, proper and timely treatment can help improve many cases.\" Besides this, some homosexual cases too had been registered, but their numbers could be said to be in negligible condition in the state and city. An overview of data from the Civil Hospital shows that when the ART centre started diagnosing HIV cases, about 720 cases were reported, while now the numbers have increased to 3,700 in the city."

        "title": "Child sex abuse in men ups HIV-risk behaviour later in life",
        "body": "CHENNAI: Men who were sexually abused by other men when they were children are prone to initiating same-sex encounters, says a study. This puts them at greater risk of HIV. The study, undertaken by a team from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, covered 11,700 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 12 districts, including Chennai. It found that close to 23% of gender non-conforming boys were victimised by older trusted men, which pushed them to engage in HIV-risk behaviour later in life. Epidemiologist Sunil Solomon, who was part of the research, said when the team set out to study the burden of HIV among MSM, several participants they surveyed shared their sexual experiences as children. \u201cWhat troubled us was that many of them described it as experience, not realizing they were survivors of abuse. They thought it was natural, which only further marginalized them,\u201d said Solomon. A kothi (effeminate man) in Chennai recalled his uncle molesting him when he was three. \u201cI didn't know what he was doing,\u201d the study quoted him as saying. Later in life, he tested positive for HIV. \u201cI didn't tell anyone what happened to me. When they (his family) scold me (for having HIV), I want to say `You should have taken care when I was young. I am alone now'.\u201d According to official estimates, men who have sex with men have a 12-14 times higher prevalence of HIV than other men. The study found that the prevalence of child sexual abuse was higher among \"gender non-conforming men\" than the general population, which also increased their vulnerability to HIV. They found that those who had a history of abuse had approximately 2.5 times more lifetime male sexual partners compared to those without and the HIV prevalence was almost double in the former group. Child sexual abuse in general has been identified as an important predictor of high-risk sexual behaviour later in life for both men and women, including early sexual debut, unprotected sex, multiple partners, and engagement in transactional sex, which increases the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. A study by UNICEF, covering 13 states, found that more than half of children (53%) reported abuse, with the prevalence being higher for boys than girls (53% and 23% respectively). The study found the prevalence of child sexual abuse among the group to be the highest in Tamil Nadu where 43.2% of the participants claimed they were sexually abused, with Coimbatore having the highest at 70.2%. In Chennai, 34.3% said they were abused. Experts say the prevalence is probably high in the south because of better reporting. Child rights and LGBT activists say the study has highlighted the need for more intervention programmes for boys who have been victims of abuse. \u201cWhile abuse is generally high among children, the prevalence is exceptionally high among gender nonconforming boys. They are already grappling with being different from how the society describes their gender. Abuse just makes things tougher,\u201c said Dr L Ramakrishnan, country director, SAATHI, an organisation that works on HIV/AIDS."

        "body": "MUMBAI: A 51-year-old HIV-positive man was recently acquitted of murdering his minor son in 2016 after his wife, the complainant in the case, turned hostile. Police alleged that the accused killed the child after suspecting that he too was HIV positive like his wife, daughter and himself. The woman denied telling the cops earlier that her husband had called her up after disappearing with their son and said that he had killed him. The child was found drowned in a nullah along the railway tracks. Observing that the homicidal death of the child was not proved, the sessions court also did not find the alleged motive convincing. \"It is not believable that when his wife and daughter are suffering from HIV and they were taking treatment at a civil hospital in Jalna, then merely on suspicion that the deceased might be suffering from HIV, he would take such a drastic step of taking the life of his son,\" the court said. The accused and his wife had six children. The accused had been in jail from July 11, 2016. The prosecution stated that on July 5, 2016, the son was crying so the accused took him out. The prosecution said after there no trace of the father and the son, the woman appproached the police at 4am the next day, and later the accused called her on her phone and said he had killed their son. Pointing to her statement during the trial, the court said her evidence showed that her son was missing, so her husband went to search him."

The doctors, on Sunday, asked her attendants to arrange two units of blood. This was confirmed by Dr J P Gupta, who is treating her. \"She requires blood and if her attendants fail to arrange it, it can spell trouble for the patient,\" he said. Her son Babloo could not arrange blood till Sunday evening and this might hamper treatment, he stated, adding the patient passed stool on Sunday too and there was no need to worry. On the other hand, Babloo said he went to the blood bank twice at 12pm and 4pm for replacement blood, but the officials there didn't take blood from the donor citing lack of staff. He also rues why was he asked to donate blood since HIV positive patients are not required to give blood for replacement blood. An order of the state government dated February 23, 2012, a copy of which had been sent to superintendents of all the hospitals, says, \"NACO-supported blood banks would supply blood to people living with HIV/AIDS without asking for replacement.\" However, PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said he was not aware of any such order. Babloo expressed satisfaction that his mother was allotted a bed on Saturday night, but said at times there was no one to help. \"She was suffering from breathlessness late in the afternoon today and nurses told us to take her to emergency, but there was no one in the ward to take her there,\" he said."

According to reports, the state chief minister has also sanctioned a sum of Rs 5 lakh for the children which would be handed to them soon. The parents of the teenaged children- Irfan, Adil, Ikhlaq, Moonis and their sister Nishath Bano died of AIDS within a span of two years. The ill-fated children were pushed out of their ancestral house by their uncle who believed they too suffered from the disease. Seeking refuge in a graveyard, the children faced hostile weather conditions and shared a single cot. President, Alliance Club International, Roshan Lal Amar Vaishya who reportedly first came to know about the children's sufferings on July 16 this year said he visited the children at the graveyard the next day and provided them food and clothes. On July 18, Vaishya accompanied by some local social activists met the district magistrate and sought his intervention even as the incident was reported by the media too. \"The children said they were very frightened to sleep inside the graveyard in the night and it was only during the wee hours that they could manage to sleep for 2 to 3 hours. Their uncle had apparently boycotted them fearing that they are also carrying the dreaded HIV virus,\" Vaishya said. DM Vidya Bhushan visited the children on Friday with chief medical officer (CMO) and his team that conducted their medical check up and declared them medically fit with no symptoms of presence of HIV virus, said ADM, City Puneet Shukla while talking to TOI on Friday. He said efforts are on to provide the children financial assistance under Lohia Awas Yojana amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh for constructing their home on the patta land. On the other hand, Alliance Club international has pledged to bear the expenses of the marriage of the girl, said Vaishya. Welcoming the development, social activist and DGC, Civil, Vivek Upadhaya said, \"The development is quite heartening in the wake of ongoing holy month of Ramzan.\""

President, BNPPLH, Manoj Kumar Singh said, \"We have arranged the medical help from the hospital authorities and now seeking help of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) for proper recovery of the patient. As the patient has a history of drug addiction which caused sceptic infection in his leg, we are also trying to get the patient admitted for drug rehabilitation as well.\" It may be noted that, despite being admitted in the divisional hospital for over two weeks, Ram is suffering from severe septic infection in his left leg. The patient said he was involved in drug addiction and received septic infection along with HIV infection by using infected syringe. The paramedical staff of the hospital refused to attend him because of HIV infection and his mother used to bandage his wounds. He was lying neglected on the bed number 12 in ward number two of the hospital. According to Manoj, such incidences are very common as most of the paramedical staff in hospitals refrain from touching the HIV positive people. \"We have been continuously trying to stop discrimination against HIV patients at health centres and hospitals. The HIV+ people are not given regular medicines required for the common ailments like cough, cold, fever, injury, if they reach various primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs).\""

The event, 'Children Se Dosti,' was jointly organised by Childline 1098 and DCPU in collaboration with Operation Rainbow, a centre that cares and supports the children affect ted by HIV/AIDS. Advising the people to be friendly with such children, the district child protection officer (DPCO) R Devika, who spoke on the occasion, said, \"Such children are punished for no mistake of theirs. Instead of isolating them, people should behave in a friendly manner.\" During the event, children tied friendship bands on the each others' wrists and the organisers to establish friendship. What added colour to the event was the decision of DPCO to send a proposal to the district collector to provide assistance to empower them. \"When I talked to some of the children here, I realised that most of them do not have parents or have a single parent, who are also infected with HIV. This provoked us to help them to come up in society. We have got a list of 17 children from the Operation Rainbow. Likewise, we will also try to collect lists of such children from other NGOs. Then we will send it to the district administration seeking their assistance,\" the DPCO told TOI. She also warned the unregistered children homes in the district to register as per Juvenile Justice Act, 2000. \"Many of the homes in the district have not been registered as per the Act, though we had sent them reminders. Sever action would be take action against such homes,\" the DPCO warned. The children were also taught how to distinguish the safe and unsafe touches by people in the family and outside.

The finding is an important step towards developing a vaginal gel that may prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis said. \u201cOur hope is that in places where HIV is running rampant, people could use this gel as a preventive measure to stop the initial infection,\u201d said researcher Joshua L Hood. Bee venom contains a potent toxin called melittin that can poke holes in the protective envelope that surrounds HIV, and other viruses. Large amounts of free melittin can cause a lot of damage. The new study shows that melittin loaded onto these nanoparticles does not harm normal cells because Hood added protective bumpers to the nanoparticle surface. When the nanoparticles come into contact with normal cells, which are much larger in size, the particles simply bounce off."

        "body": "Aids researchers believe the time may have come to think the unthinkable: a growing body of expert opinion believes a cure for HIV infection is no longer a scientific impossibility but a realistic goal that scientists could reach in the very near future. A scientist who shared a Nobel prize for the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has now added her voice to those who believe it is possible to cure a viral infection that until now has been considered life-long , chronic and, although treatable, ultimately incurable. Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi , who first reported the discovery of the Aids virus in 1983 with her colleague Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, cited this week the case of the \u201cBerlin Patient\u201d , an American gay man called Timothy Brown who received a bone marrow transplant in 2007 while a student in Germany . The transplant was undertaken to treat a type of blood cancer but in the process it also apparently cured Mr Brown of his HIV infection. Five years after his transplant, he continues to be free of HIV despite having given up his anti-viral drugs. It is still not clear to scientists why Mr Brown has managed to shrug off his chronic HIV infection so effectively. For decades, a cure for Aids has been little more than a pipe dream because of the ability of the virus to integrate itself within the genetic material of infected patients. Once installed within a patient\u2019s DNA, the Aids virus could \u201chide away\u201d for years, even decades, from the body\u2019s immune defences. As a result, scientists realised soon after HIV was discovered in the early 1980s that infected people would continue to be at risk of developing Aids throughout their life unless continuously treated with anti-viral drugs. But Mr Brown\u2019s highly unusual case has given some scientists cause for optimism. In a comment article in this week\u2019s Nature, Professor Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleague Professor Steven Deeks of the University of California, San Francisco, say that Mr Brown has been effectively cured of HIV \u2014 the first person in the world to fulfil the strict scientific definition of a cure. Professor Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Professor Deeks took part this week in the launch of a global scientific strategy document for Aids and HIV prior to the 2012 International Aids Conference which begins next week. The document will place \u201ccure research\u201d centre stage, suggesting that instead of focusing almost exclusively on research into better anti-viral drugs and HIV vaccines, scientists should think about ways of curing patients outright.

HIV Infections were highest in Aizawl district followed by Champhai district.

        "body": "VISAKHAPATNAM: Twenty-year-old Sujata's (name changed) dreams and joy of becoming mother of a healthy child were shattered when she underwent blood tests during pregnancy. The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for HIV/AIDS. What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease. Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family. \"She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,\" her mother Savitri said. Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades. But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. \"We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,\" said an official of One Town police station. For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage? \"This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,\" pointed out Dr Surya Rao. The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. \"In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,\" he said. Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. \"The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,\" said Dr Prabhakar. Host of awareness programmes today On the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday, the Port City is hosting a number of awareness programmes in tune with this year's theme of 'Getting to zero'. As per the theme, the aim is to achieve zero figure in various areas such as - new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths' for period 2011-15. Addressing the media here on Friday, additional district medical health officer (AIDS and Leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh said that AP has around five lakh HIV positive persons, of which 5.78 per cent are from Vizag district alone. Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a medical practitioner, who had been treating the HIV/AIDS-infected and affected in the city, said the focus this time was on the student community to raise awareness levels as education plays a vital role in creating awareness. As part of this, a first of its kind human AIDS red ribbon chain would be formed at the campus of Government College for Women at 10 am on Saturday. Apart from this, a 40 feet high burning red ribbon would be displayed there. Meanwhile, the district medical, health and family welfare department in collaboration with the Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is also organising a rally at 9 am from GVMC to Jagadamba on the occasion. Around 500 nursing students are expected to participate in the rally apart from female sex workers. \"A public meeting will also be held from 10.30 am and will be addressed by the district collector and chairman of district AIDS Prevention and Control Committee V Seshadri in the presence of GVMC commissioner,\" Ramesh said."

So, even though it took her some time, this 28-year-old woman, who is HIV positive as is her six-year-old daughter, managed to convince the villagers of Longe, Kolhapur, that neither she nor her daughter are a threat to society. This August, the Longe gram panchayat \"respectfully requested her to return as an anganwadi worker and allowed her daughter to attend the village school.\" The woman told TOI, \"I am relieved that I can live with dignity. This is an important win.\" It all started in early 2009. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, founder-president of NGO Prayas, that works for the uplift and fair treatment of the HIV-affected, narrated the woman's story. \"Her husband was first detected with HIV in early 2009 at the village primary healthcare centre. She too underwent the test. Both the woman and her daughter tested positive, though her older son did not,\" she said. \" When the villagers came to know their status, they were not uncooperative. They helped the family in many ways.\" Eventually, the woman's husband passed away in late 2009. Though she continued to be in good health several eyebrows were raised at the fact that she was an anganwadi sevika. \"Parents were worried that her proximity to their children would prove detrimental to their health and well-being and that her little daughter would pass on the infection to other children in the village school. Now these worries are neither scientific nor logical. Nevertheless, she was asked to stay home with the promise that her salary would be sent to her. Her daughter was denied admission to the school. When this state of existence was unacceptable to her, the woman left the village with her children,\" Kulkarni said. She went to Mumbai this June and got in touch with the media, as well as various NGOs that work for the HIV positive. Her voice was heard and gradually the wheels of hope began spinning once again, especially when tehsildar Vijaya Jadhav got to know of the situation. A meeting with the gram sabha of Longe village was initiated. Officials from the district HIV programme, various NGOs like the Network of Positive People, Lotus Medical Foundation, Red Cross Society, Sakhi Sanghatan and Jeevan Jyot, as well as members of the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society were present. At the meeting, Sanjeevani Kulkarni and Pravin Naik, district HIV programme officer, Kolhapur, put to rest every niggling suspicion and query in the villagers' mind. \"The meeting lasted for over two hours, and we were successful in convincing the villagers that the woman and her child were far from being a threat,\" said Kulkarni. \"The villagers promised to look after her and her daughter in every way.\" Drupada Kumhare, sarpanch of Longe, said, \"We are convinced that there is no way that one can get infected with HIV just by coexisting with a positive person.\" Deputy sarpanch Subhash Patil said, \"We were afraid that our children could get infected if her daughter would play with them. But now we know that there is no such chance.\" A village-level committee comprising the sarpanch, deputy sarpanch as well as members of the village conflict redressal committee will support the woman. \"She is in good health. And so far, there has been no need for anti-retroviral therapy for her,\" added Kulkarni."

They had married for love and were expecting their first child. Then a routine blood test brought their world crashing down. Batashi was inexplicably diagnosed HIV positive at Kolkata's School of Tropical Medicine (STM). A test on Tarak proved negative. What followed was worse than nightmare for Batashi. Her in-laws ostracized her and her husband accused her of straying. Tarak would have kicked her out had a little compassion for the woman he had once loved not lurked in one corner of his heart. Batashi had to attend several sessions of counselling while carrying her baby to term. Her son, born last May, was healthy. She had to travel to Kolkata regularly for more tests. Last week, following another round of tests at STM, she was told as suddenly as she was informed the first time that she did not have the virus. On Tuesday, after a repeat test, doctors at STM told her \"to go home and take rest\" because she wasn't HIV positive after all. \"When we went to collect the report last Wednesday, we were told that my wife did not have HIV. We couldn't believe it at first. Then I saw tears well up in my wife's eyes. I was so happy for her. It took us some time to regain composure,\" said Tarak, a cable operator. \"I always knew that I couldn't have contracted the virus. But I had reconciled to my fate after the reports. No one can imagine the trauma I've been through. I was ostracized, ridiculed and my marriage was on the rocks. I wasn't even allowed to breastfeed my baby,\" said Batashi."

        "body": "MADURAI: In a landmark order, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court has granted divorce to a man on the ground that his wife was HIV-positive, equating the condition to a venereal disease. \u201cWhen a spouse is HIV-positive, the other spouse is entitled for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act,\u201d Justice R S Ramanathan ruled last week. Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said. Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce. \u201cIn the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of the Section 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,\u201d Justice Ramanathan said. The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court. When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife\u2019s counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted. However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government General Hospital in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court."

Better access to medical treatment and easy access to nutrition and continuation of education are among their primary demands. After a public hearing on `Child rights -- issues and entitlements of the orphan and vulnerable children affected/infected by HIV/ AIDS', Shantha Sinha, chairperson, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), said four things topped their list of demands. \"A comprehensive nutrition programme is needed. Continuation of education is a problem for most because of social stigma,\" she said. The question of property rights is another bane for these children because many are thrown out of their homes with even siblings distancing themselves. \"This is fracturing families. Also, in several cases, there are no parents and children have to take care of the family. There are no rules on these cases ought to be handled,\" she added. The national commission is also mulling over a comprehensive child health policy and on conducting such public hearing at the district level. These have been held in Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Tamil Nadu. A pilot hearing in Udupi, where the incidence of HIV/AIDS affected children is very high, is being considered. Both the national and state commissions were unanimous in saying the biggest problem was that there was no data on children affected by HIV/AIDS. However, it's estimated there are about 55,000 children orphaned due to AIDS or other reasons in just three districts of Belgaum, Bagalkot and Bellary. Guidelines not operational Though there are guidelines for children with HIV/AIDS, which have details on how to handle such cases, social workers say these are not yet operational on ground. Neither has the HIV Bill been passed. Nina P Naik, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said there was no plan in the state for children affected with HIV/AIDS. If parents die, the ration card for the family is cancelled and they are not considered to be below the poverty line. \"HIV positive women with a son over 18 years no longer gets a widow pension. There is also a movement nationwide to include HIV positive people under the disability pension scheme,\" she added. It's been estimated that every 15 seconds a child loses a parent to AIDS and there are about 2 million children under 15 years who are living with HIV. According to a UNAIDS 2008 report, about 15 million orphans are AIDS orphans. toiblr.reporter@timesgroup.com"

        "body": "PANAJI: Over the years, the rate of HIV infection has declined in Goa and some four-five new cases of HIV/AIDS are detected every month. But, what\u2019s bothering doctors and counsellors working with people living with HIV/AIDS is the casual attitude of the infected persons. Despite counselling, many don\u2019t take any precautions and pass on the infection to his/her partner. The ART (anti-retroviral therapy) center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, receives many such cases. At the end of the day, the staff members find themselves exasperated when a new case of HIV is detected, and the source of infection is one of the patients taking treatment at the center. \u201cAnd we wonder whether we are doing any good to the society. We help them get well, and they go out and spread infection,\u201d said a ART staff member who recently dealt with a case of a 24-year-old man, who gave infection to his wife. When he walked in the center a year ago, he was thoroughly counselled along with his mother and told not to get married. \u201cNot only did he marry a HIV negative girl, but within a year had his 19-year-old wife infected, and now he wants to have a child too,\u201d said a ART member. \u201cI wanted somebody to take care of my son,\u201d was the mother\u2018s lame excuse when questioned about her son's marriage. The staff at the ART center has tried its best to dissuade him from having a child, but he is adamant. \u201cWe have even told him that the baby may be born HIV positive. But you know, what he said? \u2018You people will cure him\u2019. The staff member said she was infuriated when he heard him say that. A counsellor said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that all don\u2019t listen, but then there\u2019s no way we can do anything other than telling them what they should and should not do.\u201d \u201cWhen we counsel them, they hear us with rapt attention. When we ask whether they will follow our instructions, they answer in the affirmative. But some chose to defy us,\u201d she adds. She also said that some of the commercial sex workers who visit the ART center to collect their regular dose of medicines, have been spotted by them soliciting customers. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS), said this type of attitude is evident among HIV/AIDS patients as they want to prove to others that they are normal. \u201cThey want to also hide their infection also because of stigma attached to HIV/AIDs,\u201d she said further adding they are doing all they can do to generate awareness about HIV/AIDS."

A survey by the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, revealed that over 56 per cent respondents were not allowed to drink water from the facilities available at the ART centres. Moreover, 32 per cent surveyed patients said there were no drinking water facilities and toilets at the centres. Presenting the findings at the Orissa MDG (millennium development goal) Forum recently, principal researcher of the study Andrew Dutta said over 50 per cent HIV positive people were not satisfied with the ART services in the state. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) were not getting information on adherence and side-effects of ART from these centres. Dutta said the ART centres were found wanting in offering services like counselling on nutritional support, availability of nutritional supplements and clarity and check-up on side effects. One-third of the patients were unwilling to revisit the ART centres for lack of laboratory technician and proper ambience. It is also difficult on the part of patients to get the CD4 tests done at the centre for staff shortage. These forced them to come to the centres again and again. The survey said some HIV positive people were not visiting the ART centres due to fear of rejection and discrimination. The study recommends addressing absenteeism among doctors, nurses and paramedical staff through mechanized attendance system and train counsellors to better handle the AIDS patients. Commenting on the study, HIV/AIDS activist Dilip Samal said, \"The findings are on expected lines. The awareness level on HIV/AIDS is still very low and discrimination against AIDS patients continues.\" The state has nine ART centres and 13 Link ART centres. The study was undertaken in the ART centres of the three medical colleges, district headquarters hospital of Koraput and the two ART centres in Bhadrak and Bhubaneswar.

Some of the NGOs have said that improper mentoring and irregular funding were also to be blamed for their poor performance. City-based NGO Humsafar Trust that faired unimpressively in the National Aids Control Organization\u2019s (NACO) evaluation has not managed to pay salaries of its staffers since March this year. According to the report, the NGO that has been handling three projects in Mankhurd, Mahim and Mulund among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender population, had also reported delay of six to eight months in release of the annual budget. The report, a copy of which is with TOI, states clearly that delay in funds has hampered the project activities. Ashok Row Kavi, trustee of Humsafar Trust, said, the three projects funded by Avert Society were reeling under a fund crunch for nearly six months. \u201cThe pattern of different funding agencies differs. Avert Society has to get approval from several departments. The fund comes from the US to NACO and eventually reaches NGOs,\u201d he said adding that the funds were not paid in advance but reimbursed later. Kavi added that the audit records of the NGO were complete and audited as per Avert\u2019s requirements. The only NGO that met all parameters in the NACO evaluation was Jalna\u2019s Setu Trust. The report stated clearly that right from maintaining proper data to maintaining accounts, the NGO seemed to fulfil all parameters. Others NGOs in question like Marathwada Gramin Vikas Sanstha in Aurangabad also reported delays in funding.

The sole NGO, which is currently working with the MSM (men who have sex with men) population, is involved in a number of programmes, but others say not enough is being done to cover a large migrant population in the city that is potential risk for people in other states. According to Srikant of Society For Service To Voluntary Agencies (SOSVA), the only active NGO currently working among the MSM population, there is a large migrant population and female sex workers who are currently not made aware of HIV/AIDS at the ground level. \u201cThe migrant population changes every six to seven months, so there is a constant requirement to raise awareness among them. The risk of HIV is not only limited to them, but also extends to their wives and families when they go back home,\u201d Srikant says. Gurgaon has already recorded 158 cases of HIV till the end of October 2016. The number of cases in 2015 was 184, while the figure stood at 144 and 145 in the 2014 and 2013, respectively, according to the data provided by Haryana State AIDS Control Society\u2019s nodal officer (Gurgaon). According to a statement of the Haryana State AIDS Control Society, the stage IV of NACO was launched in the state with the objective of \u201cconsolidating gains of reaching out to hard to reach population with intensity and building bridges over learnt lessons in the light of new challenges of rising vulnerabilities among general population especially less educated females and emerging infection due to unabated migration at the hub of rapid urbanisation and growing industrialisation in major parts of state.\u201d However, according to the NGOs that have been shut down, this is not the case. \u201cThe ICTCs (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre) have their limits. They do not work at the ground level. These used to do condom demonstrations and promotion and also used to promote HIV testing. All these have been shut down now,\u201d says Raj Singh, who used to run an NGO to raise HIV awareness among migrant workers in the state. Dr Pramod Kumar, whose work was primarily among the female sex workers (FSW) bemoans the shutting down of his NGO. \u201cOne fine day, we got an e-mail and we were asked to shut down, and no reasons were given.\u201d The state, he claims, is not interested in promoting these programmes. \u201cThis was clear when they stopped our funding a year ago before we were shut down. Clearly their priorities are different,\u201d he adds. Shikha Garg, who is the ICTC counsellor in Gurgaon, says the results of these NGOs were not satisfactory and therefore they had to be shut down. \u201cThey failed to get migrants to come for tests, which is possibly the reason they were closed,\u201d she says. However, Raj Singh disagrees. \u201cThere was no complaint, everything was going smoothly. We are still waiting for the government to reinstate us,\u201d he says, hopeful to restart working among the ever increasing migrant population. Dr Vijay Kumar, the nodal officer for the Haryana State AIDS Control Society in Gurgaon, said the changes happened at the state level, \u201cwe just work at the implementation level,\u201d he said. Officials at the state level remained unavailable for comment."

Gyan was leading a happy married life and engaged in gemstones\u2019 business till September 2000, when he met an accident. \u201cI was hospitalized at a government hospital for 15 days. But, I started falling ill frequently after that,\u201d says Gyan. Probably, he contracted AIDS there, but he was unaware of it. In the meantime, he donated blood for a friend. After 15 days, he got a letter saying he should contact an ART centre. \u201cI did not know what it was. When I went there, the banners talking about AIDS made me realize the impending disaster in my life,\u201d Gyan says. Both he and his wife tested positive for AIDS. \u201cWe went into hiding for 15 days,\u201d he says.

Over 1,000 persons awaiting surgeries are registered with his organization, which also provides counselling to people with AIDS and even marries them off. Recently, Gyan organized wedding of three HIV positive couples. Asked about the lowest point in his struggle, he narrates a 2012 incident when he was sitting on dharna to protest shortage of antiretroviral drugs at BSACS office. \u201cI was arrested and murder charge was slapped on me,\u201d says Gyan, who was jailed for a month and released on bail thereafter."

I am also told that they have run out of condoms at targeted interventions, compromising efforts to curb the spread of the virus,\" said P Kousalya, president, Positive Women Network, a Chennai based NGO. Another concern is that the doctors and counsellors at ART centres have not been getting their salaries for the past few months. \"They are out of HIV testing kits in several centres. Non-availability of paediatric doses is another problem,\" she said. Although they had brought the issue to the notice of DAC, the State Aids Control Society (SACS) and the District Aids Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), no action was taken. \"Given that there were several lapses in administration when the DAC was an individual department, how can the Centre merge it with the Union health ministry? The concern is that the attention given to AIDS patients would be diluted amidst the various priorities of the health department,\" she added. Similar sentiments were expressed by Dr Ashok Rau, executive trustee and chief executive officer (CEO) of Freedom Foundation-India, a Bangalore based NGO. He said the Centre's strategy for healthcare could be seen as a recipe for disaster. The role of SACS would be diminished amidst a flourish of central and state level public health initiatives, he added."

After he read a few tweets urging people to help those stuck in Mumbai, he thought of creating a Google Doc spreadsheet which could send out the details of those in need and those willing to help. \u201cAs soon as I heard about the blasts, I tweeted, \u2018Someone in Mumbai please create a Google Doc with numbers/addresses of people willing to help\u2019. Then I thought, if someone has to do it, why not me? It\u2019d be the same thing. The aim was to reach out to people who were in need of help. While one group of people updated the spreadsheet, others got busy sharing the info with the victims. Within minutes, more information started flowing in. It might have started with just five names and phone numbers which I added, but soon, a lot of information was available online,\u201d he says. Nitin hails from Moradabad, lives in Delhi with friends and works as senior product manager at MapmyIndia. He says that the reaction from common people has been so positive and overwhelming that it has made the process of transmitting valuable information a lot easier. \u201cSince Wednesday evening, I have been inundated with emails asking about the process, to offer support to the victims. I have been approached by NGOs to rehabilitate those affected in Mumbai. Besides, the warden of a Chennai-based hostel is willing to arrange blood donors and a psychiatrist has shown interest in helping out with therapy for those affected by this traumatic experience,\u201d he says. He believes that this tragedy has not only sensitized people to the horrors of terrorism, but also helped them realize the benefits of social networking sites. \u201cA friend told me that this effort has helped people see how simple it is to provide help and organize it. In critical moments, they normally don\u2019t know how to react. Chaos and panic prevents help from reaching those who need it. But what we did needed only a few clicks.\u201d Three years ago, however, when 26/11 ravaged Mumbai, Nitin\u2019s response was quite different, and regrettably so, he says, explaining how microblogging sites have changed people\u2019s lives. \u201cDuring the 2008 Mumbai attacks, I may have been at a dhaba venting my angst at what had happened, not being able to do anything worthwhile. But now things have changed. God forbid, if anything like this happens, I know there\u2019ll be many people doing something similar to offer immediate aid to victims.\u201d"

The prevalence of HIV is almost double in villages with high migratory population in comparison to the average number of HIV cases in the state. \u201cDuring the screening for HIV among migratory population, we found that 0.59% was affected with HIV. However, confirmatory tests are yet to be done. All those tested HIV positive during screening were advised to undergo second and third round of confirmatory tests,\u201c a Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) official said. The HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, released recently, showed that the prevalence of HIV AIDS has increased from 0.19% (in 2008-09) to 0.32% in 2010-11. Now, the health authorities have expressed concern over the high percentage of HIV cases among migratory population. According to the official, they screened 20,037 persons for HIV during the 10day camps organised in 100 different villages of 11 districts. The villages were identified on the basis of large number of people migrating to other states for work and returning during festive season. In terms of numbers, the official said that they found 119 persons who tested positive for HIV during the screening. He said that these 119 persons were not even aware that they were infected with HIV . He said that migratory population is always at risk of having HIV . It is a high risk group as they have to stay outside their homes for a long period without their spouses to earn livelihood. Accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers helped RSACS in identifying 100 villages with high migratory population. Apart from HIV screening, the camps were organised for health check-up.There were doctors in the camps who provided consultation to the persons who visited the camps. The 100 identified villages are situated in 11 districts -Barmer, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Dungarpur, Jalore, Pali, Rajsamand, Sirohi, Udaipur, Sikar and Jhunjhunu."

        "body": "The HIV epidemic is far from over, and needs more funds \u2013 and medicines \u2013 said public health experts from one of the foremost medical schools in US. \"There will be a significant shortfall in the funding needed for HIV control in sub-Saharan Africa in the coming years and those countries with the highest HIV burden will be unable to meet their obligations on their own to sustain control efforts,\" according to researchers at Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health. India too has many issues with medication and finances for HIV control programmes; many patient groups throughout 2015 complained out drug stockouts that resulted in the most vulnerable patients not getting their medicines continuously as prescribed. In a research paper that appeared in the BMJ Open on Sunday, the researchers calculated that the price tag for providing long-term HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in 2015-2050 in the nine sub-Saharan countries most affected by the epidemic ranges from $98 billion at current coverage levels to $261 billion if coverage is scaled up. \"The HIV epidemic is far from over,\" said first author Rifat Atun, professor of global health systems, in a press release sent by the school of public health. \"The magnitude of funding needed to sustain the HIV fight is very large and the consequences of complacency even larger.\" Atun and colleagues looked at the nine countries that account for 70% of the HIV burden in Africa\u2014Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. \"They modeled these countries\u2019 HIV/AIDS funding needs through 2050, based on four different scenarios of coverage levels, using data from Spectrum, a publicly available tool used by UNAIDS,\" said the release. The researchers say that \u2018front-loading\u2019 investments now will be necessary to ensure that higher levels of coverage are achieved. This would ultimately reduce HIV transmission and future funding obligations. Domestic financing, the most important source of funding for HIV, will not be sufficient to meet future obligations, so new, innovative sources of funding will be necessary to both maintain and expand treatment and prevention. \"The problem of predictable and sustainable funding must be resolved,\" said Atun, noting in the paper that, \"There is an ethical responsibility to continue financing for those receiving ART, and not abandon them to death.\""

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Scientists have discovered a new natural defence against HIV infection in the form of a protein that prevents the deadly virus from replicating. \"In earlier studies, we knew that we could interfere with the spread of HIV-1, but we couldn't identify the mechanism that was stopping the process,\" said Yong-Hui Zheng, Michigan State University (MSU) associate professor and co-author of the study. \"We now know that ERManI is an essential key, and that it has the potential as a antiretroviral treatment,\" said Zheng. Antiretroviral treatments are not vaccines; they simply keep HIV in check in low levels in the body. While it could be decades before an ERManI-based treatment can be prescribed for HIV-1 patients, these results provide a strong path for future research involving human cells, and later, clinical tests. The next steps will be to test if HIV resistance can be promoted by increasing ERManI levels, said Zheng, who worked on the study with scientists from the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the University of Georgia. Most viruses have viral envelopes, or protective skins, that comprise similar building blocks of the host the pathogens are trying to infect. On the surface of the envelope, there are viral glycoproteins, known as Env spikes, which act as valets, leading viruses to binding sites that allow infections to spread at the molecular level. They serve as a key of sorts that gives viruses entry into the host to begin spreading. Zheng's lab was the first to show that HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein biosynthesis can be specifically inhibited by ERManI, which is a host enzyme to add sugars to proteins. By identifying ERManI as the target that slows the spread of HIV-1, the team showed a target in which future natural therapies can be developed. More than 1.2 million people in the US have HIV. In China, doctors diagnosed 104,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in 2014. The number of infections is rising, though overall the country still has a low rate of infection. Currently, there is no cure for HIV-1; once patients have it, they have it for life. While there are antiretroviral therapies available, they can only prolong life, albeit dramatically, but they cannot cure the disease. Current drug treatments have to be taken for a lifetime, which causes side effects and many other issues, Zheng said. \"We see a way to treat this disease by helping the body protect itself,\" he said. The study was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry."

Thirty-five-year-old Shankar (name changed) met with an accident four years ago. While getting treatment for his injured leg, he contracted the deadly HIV-virus during a blood transfusion. Over a period of time, the blood clot in the leg began to spread to the heart and lungs. The pressure on the lungs began on show on the right side of the heart, which began to fail. Barring his wife, everyone in his family deserted him. \"When he came to us two weeks ago, he was almost bedridden. We conducted the Pulmonary Endarterectomy. Since he was HIV positive, we had to take extra precautions while conducting the surgery. We use nearly 100 needles and even if one gets infected, it is dangerous. But we decided to take on the challenge and operated him,\" Dr Devi Shetty, chief cardiac surgeon at Narayana Hrudayalaya told The Times of India. Narayana Hrudayalaya does the second largest number of this surgery in the world. \"The idea was to tell the world that it is safe to operate HIV patients too. There is no doubt that it is risky and extra precautions must be ensured during the surgery,\" Shetty said. IT IS RE-BIRTH FOR ME Many hospitals refused to treat me because I was carrying the deadly virus. No one even cared if I died. It was not my fault that I became HIV-positive. I was almost bedridden. Dr Shetty is like God to me. He has given me new life. All I want to say is that there is nothing to fear in life. Being HIV-positive is a different issue but other health problems need to be treated as well. Just have courage to fight... (he breaks down). HOW WAS IT DONE During the six-hour open heart surgery, the body temperature is reduced to 18 degree (the normal temperature is 37 degree). The surgery is conducted in circulatory arrest, where the patient's body is frozen and entire blood collected to a reservoir. According to Dr Shetty the entire operation is conducted when the body is bloodless. Post-surgery the blood is pumped back into the body and the temperture is restored to 37 degrees."

Mashroo is the chairman of this blood bank, which was being run on the Junagadh government hospital campus without registration. Even the HC raised various questions on the existence of this blood bank in the government premises and criticized former investigating officer \u2014 IPS Shobha Bhutada in harsh manner for going soft on the blood bank office bearers in her probe. In its lengthy order, the high court had elaborately recorded how the blood bank illegally was functioning in the government hospital. The court also highlighted the fact that despite not being registered, the blood bank was even listed in state government\u2019s official website. In its FIR submitted to the special court in the city, the CBI has leveled all those charges earlier applied in this case by the Gujarat police against the accused persons \u2014 culpable homicide not amount to murder, causing hurt by means of poison and abetment. Other accused persons held by the CBI, though not named any, are the civil surgeon of the government hospital and the pathology department officials. On June 17, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala transferred the case to the CBI for further probe. This was despite strong objection from the state government. In transferring the probe, the court said that handing over the probe to an independent agency could instill confidence among people in circumstances, wherein inaction was apparent. Lately, even the CBI starting showing reluctance to take up probe in Gujarat, as in one of such cases the central agency claimed severe shortage of staff and maintained that most of its resources are engaged in the police encounter probes in Gujarat only, and it cannot summon other officials from Delhi. This probe is being supervised by the Gandhinagar-based CBI officer Deepak Damor."

Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge. Her daughter is underweight and Lakshmi is unable to provide her with nutritious meals because she has to spend most of her earnings on medicines. \"I can only afford rice, not green leafy vegetables, milk and eggs that the doctor advised for my daughter. Where will I find the money for it,\" she says. Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household. The study shows that the effect of food insecurity in these families has left 72% of children above five and living with HIV underweight, about 69% with stunted growth and 76% wasting (low weight for height). The proportion was high especially when compared to data from the National Family Health Survey which shows the national average for underweight children and those with stunted growth below the age of five varies between 40 and 50% and between 48 and 60% respectively. READ ALSO: Four states in south make up 50% of HIV cases The 147 children aged between one and 15 years surveyed for the study conducted at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of a government tertiary-care hospital were either under the care of a single parent, mostly the mother as the father had died of HIV, or under foster care. \"Food insecurity in households is a problem across the country and one might ask why only children with HIV. Infections like HIV are catabolic diseases which results in diminished muscle mass and body fat. So, the daily dietary need of those with HIV is more,\" says C Padmapriyadarsini, scientist, NIRT. READ ALSO: HIV may stay hidden in 'quiet' immune cells Since malnutrition in early childhood has a spiralling effect leading to decreased cognitive, psychosocial and physical development which would affect the academic performance of the child, NIRT has recommended measures to complement the ART course. While Anti-Retroviral Therapy has been effective in controlling the disease, the study suggests interventions like targeted food assistance to the families. READ ALSO: What makes HIV vaccines backfire? Padmapriyadarsini says that a nutritional supplement would also go a long way in increasing adherence to drug management and improving nutritional status. The drugs would then act better on the individual without adverse effects and it would enhance a child's development. READ ALSO: HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds The children involved in the NIRT study have been regularly provided with such nutritional supplements and their parents trained to provide such a diet at home at low cost. The study was done in association with Institute of Child Health and Hospital For Children and Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. NIRT now hopes that it can convince policymakers to adopt a similar strategy on a broader level. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, there are 6,504 children living with HIV/AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 2,201 are boys and 1,849 are girls aged below 15, who are on ART as of September 2014."

Instead, with one patch applied on their skin every week, such patients will be able to fight the dreadful disease! A researcher at the Department of Pharmacy of M S University's Faculty of Technology and Engineering is developing formulations for transdermal delivery of an anti-HIV drug known as Lopinavir. The research project, which started in 2010 with Rs 10.5 lakh fund allotted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), is aimed at developing formulations which can deliver the anti-HIV drug through skin. At present, the anti-HIV drug formulations are in the oral tablet form. The research is aimed at making the drug more effective. \"Consumed in the oral form - tablets - the drug goes to liver and then to blood, where it acts against the virus. However, almost 80 per cent of this drug gets destroyed in liver by the enzymes and only 20 per cent of it reaches the blood and other organs of the body where it is actually needed,\" Dr Hetal Thakkar, who in course of the project has studied the transdermal drug delivery projects undertaken by the United States and United Kingdom-based reputed laboratories, told TOI. \"If the drug can be delivered through skin, then it will directly reach the blood without encountering the liver and hence is saved from destruction. But skin is a tough protective barrier and hence delivery of drugs through skin is difficult,\" said Thakkar, adding that to overcome this limitation, the drug was entrapped in nanocarriers which can easily permeate through skin. \"We have conducted studies on animals and we have got some promising results. When we compared the formulations developed by us with the oral formulations on rats, we found that there is nearly three times higher blood concentration which means we can also reduce the dosage of anti-HIV drug. Now, we will apply for clinical trials,\" said Thakkar. According to Thakkar, reduction in dosage of the drug will also help reduce the side effects of the drug like nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal disturbances which HIV/AIDS patients complain about during treatment. \"If the side-effects can be reduced, the overall quality of life of the patients will improve and help in building of a healthy society. Also, the treatment will be more economical,\" she said."

Saravanan\u2019s case is among those that have exposed the state government\u2019s poor follow-up mechanism for children who test positive for HIV at birth. Statistics from Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) show that of the 200 new cases of mother-to-child transmission detected in 2017, most were in the age group of 10 to 15. The data correlates with a study published last year by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis. Researchers surveyed 656 children in Tamil Nadu in the 5-14 age group who registered for HIV care in 43 centres that offer antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. One in five of these children were lost to follow-up in a year. Children less than 15 years old constitute 7% of the HIV-infected in India. More than 90% of these cases are the result of mother-tochild transmission (MTCT). Doctors can say with certainty by the 18th month if an infant has got the virus from an infected mother, HIV specialist Dr S Sundar said. \u201cThe state loses its first opportunity of preventing transmission by putting infected mothers on ARV prophylaxis too late,\u201d he said. Adequate ARV can reduce risk of MTCT to less than 2%. It misses a second opportunity after a child is diagnosed, Dr Sundar said. \u201cIn some instances, they may not show symptoms. There are chances that they will infect others as adults,\u201d he said. Doctors say early diagnosis and initiation of ART in children less than two years of age is important as failure to do so may result in early mortality. As for the rest, a study published recently by doctors from the Institute of Child Health, Egmore, offers a telling picture. The team studied 100 children (18 months to 12 years) who were diagnosed with HIV in a government medical college in Salem: About 20% of children under the age of four died due to complications related to the disease, 25% of them had tuberculosis, 12% of them had problems with their central nervous system and 16% had blood-related disorders. Only 22 of them were asymptomatic. Dr Murali Thandavarayan, one of the authors, said besides clinical manifestations, a majority were malnourished. \u201cHIV in children has faster progression because of immature immunity. Early identification and management is crucial,\u201d he said. Officials say reasons for the loss to follow-up include unaccounted deaths, healthy children whose caregivers do not perceive the need to visit the ART centre, distance to these centres as well as the stigma involved. \u201cSometimes we find it difficult to track these children as the mothers deliver in their parents\u2019 homes,\u201d said Dr E Suresh, who heads the ART centre in ICH. Tansacs officials said they stepped up surveillance in the past six months. If children do not attend on the scheduled date, the outreach workers immdiately contact the family. *name changed"

His time is not taken up by coaching classes or tuitions, but by an unending wait for the state transport bus which takes him to college and back. Though college starts at 11am, he has to catch the bus at 8am as there are no services available later to take him to Latur city. Then, when his college ends at 3pm, he has to wait till 7pm for a bus to return home. An HIV positive since birth, Dhananjay has been living in a shelter home in a village near Latur for five years. His college is 15km from the shelter home, where he stays with 40 other HIV-positive children. The children, all orphans, will hold a dance and music show in Mumbai this Saturday to raise funds for a bus. The two-hour \u2018Happy music show\u2019 will have children perform to patriotic and folk songs. The show, which will include mimicry and dances, will be held from 8pm to 10pm at Shivaji Natya Mandir, Dadar. Archana, also a standard XI student, has been bubbling with excitement for the past few days ever since she learnt that they would be going to Mumbai for the performance. \u201cI hope we get to meet some celebrities. They can support us and spend time with us. We will really feel special,\u201d she said. Archana picked up dancing when a trainer visited their facility in 2013. Since then, it has become her passion and wants to make a career in dancing. \u201cTravelling to college is hectic and having a bus of our own will end our daily ordeal,\u201d she said. Ravi Bapatley, who runs the shelter home, said they have a small vehicle to take the children to a nearby school and sometimes to the college as well, but with eight children studying in Std X this year, we need a bigger vehicle. \u201cThe dance and music show is a compilation of folk art, music, dance and mimicry,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Major signs and early symptoms of HIV infection",
        "body": "HIV (human immunodeficiency infection) is an infection that attacks our body's immune system, the body's natural protection framework. Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body\u2019s natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and symptoms of HIV which you should look out for. HIV Sign and Symptom 1 : Fever One symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment. HIV Sign and Symptom 2 : Fatigue At the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue. HIV Sign and Symptom 3 : Skin rash Rash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the HIV infection. HIV Sign and Symptom 4 : Weight loss The people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms. HIV Sign and Symptom 5 : Dry cough and pneumonia Dry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus. HIV Sign and Symptom 6 : Nausea and vomiting These squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination. HIV Sign and Symptom 7 : Joint and muscle pain Lymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease. HIV Sign and Symptom 8 : Night Sweats HIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause. There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus. Tip # 1 \u2013 Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey. Tip # 2 - Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well. Tip # 3 - Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria. Tip # 4 - Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl. Tip # 5 - Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten\u2019s from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats."

        "body": "GUWAHATI: As the state observes World AIDS Day on Thursday, there is little clarity on when government hospitals will start using the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), an advanced test to detect the disease. The prohibitive cost of the test device and the lack of manpower to operate it are the factors leading to the delay in NAAT implementation in the state. NAAT, which was approved for use in 2002 by the FDA, can detect HIV infections in blood donors earlier than other screening tests because it detects viral genes rather than antibodies or antigens. The appearance of antibodies, which happens after an infected donor's immune system responds to the virus, requires time. Similarly, detection of antigens also requires time as it needs a higher level of virus to appear in the bloodstream. In both cases, a 'window period' is created during which a donor can be infected but test negative for HIV. On Tuesday, a source told TOI that the state government was ready to start NAAT in government hospitals but would need the Centre's help to install the sophisticated testing device. TOI has learned that in 2015 a proposal had been sent to the state government to make NAAT available in government hospitals and blood banks but not much headway has been made. \"Besides the cost, NAAT requires expert handling. Assam lacks the resources to operate the device,\" said an expert. The NAAT machine costs around Rs 2 to 3 crore."

        "body": "HYDERABAD: The Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) seems to be mired in a Rs 70 crore scam after officials failed to produce bills to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) on funds it released to the state for 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years. The scam came to light four days ago when TSACS officials attending a high-level meeting called by NACO's top finance department officials in New Delhi last week failed to provide proof in form of bills for their expenditure during the last two years. Vakati Karuna, commis sioner of health and family welfare, Telangana and project director, TSACS said, \u201cAn enquiry would be conducted and action taken if anyone is found guilty , but we will have to probe further to gather evidence.\u201c Records available with TOI show from August 2014 to December 2015, NACO released Rs 113 crore to TSACS for carrying out various HIVAIDs prevention programme, besides payment of salaries to hundreds of contract employees, but officials failed to account for Rs 70 crore, documents show. The non-transfer of funds to NGOs and nonimplementation of computerised financial management software system by TSACS is at the heart of the alleged scam. The issue was discussed during the high-level meeting in Delhi called by SN Naskar, under secretary (finance), NACO, in his letter on December 15, 2016. How these funds were swindled remains a mystery , but insiders claimed that corrupt officials might have created benami NGO beneficiaries. \u201cThe NGOs (called Target Intervention Groups) totalling about 178 in the twin states, including, 58 working with TSACS for HIVAIDS prevention activities, were the worst hit as officials did not pay us for these two years but claimed in their official records that our services were paid for,\u201c alleged B Jayamma, founder of city-based Chaithanya Mahila Mandali (CMM), an award winning community-based organisation working with female sex workers. Out of Rs 70 crore that remains untracked, but shown as Rs spent', Rs 40 crore belongs to these NGOs but they were never paid their dues. In a letter to the TSACS project director last month, Jayamma sought severance of her NGO's partnership with TSACS citing Rs fund crisis'. \u201cThe TSACS still owe us 21 lakh for the services we rendered to thousands of female sex workers in the city and their rehabilitation in these two years. Now, we have no money to pay to our activists,\u201c she added. Sources said 830 contract officials working in various districts in over half a dozen divisions like ART centres, basic services, district aids prevention control units (Dapcus), Integrated Counselling & Testing Centres among others have not been paid their arrears and hikes for the last two years. \u201cNACO had released funds to enable TSACS to give them hike, but it was never given to them,\u201c said an office bearer of Telangana State Aids Control Employees' Joint Action Committee, which submitted a memorandum to the government two months ago seeking clearance of their arrears. \u201cThe employees are facing a lot of problems in meeting day to day expenses as we are getting meagre salaries,\u201c the JAC said in its letter appealing for the early release of their arrears."

        "body": "PANAJI: Medical treatment cannot be denied to persons living with HIV (PLHIV) under the HIV AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2017 which is expected to be brought into force by the Central government shortly. The new act seeks to protect the rights of PLHIV, ensuring there is no discrimination against them in healthcare services, education, employment, public facilities, holding public office, property rights and insurance. Under the act, hospitals including private will not be permitted to delay surgery or charge different rates for services for PLHIV. \u201cThis would amount to discrimination as it imposes a burden on a person based on HIV related grounds,\u201d senior advocate and director of the lawyers collective Anand Grover said. He was delivering a public lecture on demystifying HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2017 at the International Centre, Goa organised by the Lawyers Collective and Positive People in anticipation of the latter\u2019s 25th anniversary. In cases of discrimination in healthcare, a PLHIV can first complain to the establishment\u2019s complaints authority to bring the problem to its notice and get it rectified, he says. If this doesn\u2019t work, a PLHIV can approach an ombudsman appointed by the state government under this act to inquire into complaints of discrimination and provision of healthcare services where he/she is expected to pass orders within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint in medical emergency cases. A state must appoint at least one ombudsman. There is also no reason why insurance premium should be double for PLHIV, Grover says, pointing out that the denial or unfair treatment in providing insurance also amounts to discrimination, provided this is supported by actuarial studies. The act also requires that no person be compelled to disclose his HIV status except with his informed consent and if required by a court order where establishments maintaining records of HIV positive persons must adopt data protection measures. Grover who fought for the rights of Dominic D\u2019Souza, one of India\u2019s first HIV activists and the first case that went to court more than two-and-a-half decades ago, says this new act originated in D\u2019Souza\u2019s fight.

Besides receiving assistance from NACO and other external aids, the Legislators' Forum on AIDS (LFA) contributes Rs 60 lakh annually (each MLA contributes Rs 1 lakh) to the Nagaland's battle against AIDS. The LFA fund is primarily used for creating awareness in respective legislative constituencies, the minister told the delegation. Informing about the introduction of nutritional support and reproductive health education in school curriculum, the minister for School Education Nyeiwang Konayk impressed upon the Unicef to help strengthening these efforts.

This has led to 778 out of 2437 HIV positive people, who are on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART), being unsure about the prognosis of their disease. After initial clamour from AIDS activists on July 10, three portable but temporary CD4 machines were provided to Kiphire, Zunheboto and Tuensang districts. But activists say the new machines are for an interim period and meant for affected people in the interior areas only. Nagaland has only four CD4 count machines in Mokochung, Tuensang, Dimapur and Kohima that are 9 to 10 years old and were brought from other states. Network of Naga People living with HIV/AIDS (NNP+) and Nagaland Users Network (NUN) have cited the situation as a ?continued negligence' on the part of the Department of AIDS Control (previously called NACO) and Nagaland State Aids Control Society (NSACS). Altogether, 2437 HIV positive people from Tuensang district of Nagaland are facing uncertainty about their present status of HIV drug treatment. CD4 testing is important in HIV treatment as it puts newly detected patients on Anti Retroviral (ARV) for regular monitoring of the present treatment. \"WHO, in its guidelines (2013), recommends more efficient test - viral load testing for treatment and monitoring to ensure adherence and timely switch to next line regimen. It is really shocking that even the basic CD4 testing is not being made available to us at the community level,\" said Naomi, President of NNP+. The networks wrote to the DAC on March 7 ,to apprise them of the frequent breakdown of the machines in 4 ART centres in Dimapur, Kohima, Mokokchung and Tuensang district Hospitals. The networks have questioned the functionality of the machines. Even a RTI was filled by a community member. \"DAC's inability to tackle this problem means disrupting a patients' treatment. They should stop playing with people's lives and put their act together. It is really shocking to see that even after our repeated reminders no remedial action was taken from DAC for replacing the machines with new ones.

Nodal officer for TB/HIV in Ujjain, Dr ML Malviya said, \u201cEvery year we are trying to screen more number of people for HIV. We are also carrying out awareness activities with the help of NGOs to sensitize people about the consequences of the deadly disease and precautions against it. As Simhastha is scheduled next year, MPSACS must be preparing its action plan.\u201d After Indore, Dhar and Ujjain are two districts along the NH3, which have a significant number of registered HIV positive cases. Being a pilgrim centre, Ujjain witnesses flow of visitors all the year round. Besides, there are truck drivers too. It results in a huge floating population. According to ART Centre incharge, MY Hospital, Dr VP Pandey, \u201cIf we look at the map of MP, we find prevalence more in developed and industrial areas.

According to the latest figures of UNAIDS, 2.4 million people in the country are living with HIV. The prevalence rate nationally is 0.3% of the population. SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta said, \u201cOut of the 21,120 pregnant women tested since 2008, 42 have tested positive. The number has reduced as there were 60 positives in 2008. However, the city comes under category B of HIV/AIDS due to injectable drug users, which is high in adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana.\u201d Meanwhile, the new case detection rate among walk-in voluntary testing of public in the ICTC centres of Chandigarh has declined from 7.1% in 2008 to 2.19% in 2012. This year the SACS has been sanctioned to start two more oral substitution therapy centres in the city to gradually wean off injectable drug users to oral therapy. \u201cWe already have eight such centres,\u201d revealed the director. The SACS has plans to rope in college and university students for spreading the message of prevention against HIV. \u201cWe have been working with the ITBP and will be sensitizing defence personnel also,\u201d said Dr Gupta."

The petition, which was filed before a special CBI court in the city, accused the agency of shielding the ruling party\u2019s MLA, Mahendra Mashroo, who was managing Sarvodaya Blood Bank that had provided blood for these kids. Twenty-seven parents have termed the CBI probe incomplete. The CBI has exonerated the laboratory, blood bank and hospital staff. But the petitioners\u2019 counsel Paresh Waghela said that mere absence of mens rea (criminal intention) on part of those responsible for this blunder was not enough to spare them. It was because of their negligence that more than 30 children contracted HIV and five of them have died so far. Advocate Waghela said that the CBI had found 529 of total 1,227 blood donors and traced the donor who had HIV positive. The 2011 reports showed that he was HIV negative. When CBI could locate one person, it proves that there was a problem in the system and there were people responsible for the same."

The RSRTC gives 75 concession on fare for travel between Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre and the patient's home. The provision of concession was introduced by the state government so that the people living with HIV/AIDS would not have to spend on fares to get medicines for HIV/AIDS, which is being provided by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society free of cost from the ART centers. However, many HIV/AIDS patients claimed they have to face problems in availing the concession. \"The bus conductor demands the pass issued by RSRTC. Since the passes refer to the holder as immunocompromised, some conductors ask us many questions about medicines and ART centers, which lead to disclosure of our HIV status,\" Sangeeta (name changed), an HIV positive woman said. NGOs working for HIV/AIDS victims also confirmed that such incidents have happened in the past. Shushila Mordiya, a got coordinator HIV positive women network of Rajasthan said, \"Such incidents have happened in the past. There is a need for RSRTC to issue passes which would not reveal the identity of HIV positive people.\" The RSRTC concession passes include the name, age, residence, of the patient, as well as ART number and the status \"immunocompromised\" apart from the signatures and stamp of ART centre's nodal officer and medical officer of the hospital. RSRTC executive director Vishram Meena said, \"We have already directed our employees that the identity of HIV/AIDS victims should not be revealed. Now, we are planning to issue concession passes which would not hint at the pass bearer's disease. Soon, we will issue different passes.\" A Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society official said, \"More than 5,000 people with HIV/AIDS are availing the benefits of concession passes. But, recently we have received only one complaint about such identity disclosure. The conductor did not allow him to travel in the bus. After that, the conductor was suspended.\""

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a novel drug candidate that may lead to a potent and universally effective HIV vaccine. Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection. \u201cOur compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,\u201d said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body\u2019s immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site. The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection. Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell. \u201cWhen antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,\u201d said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School. The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease. Once injected into muscle tissue, like HIV itself, the vehicle turns those cells into \u201cfactories\u201d that could produce enough of the new protective protein to last for years, perhaps decades, Farzan said."

Cops have booked the man\u2019s sister, a nurse, for allegedly helping him extract their mother\u2019s blood. After the incident, the two-month pregnant woman underwent an abortion. Bandra-Kurla Complex police arrested Abhimanyu Kamble (26) on September 6 for injecting the syringe into his wife\u2019s back after an argument. Kamble and his wife Anita met in 2013 and got married a year later. Barely a year into the marriage, Kamble allegedly began to physically assault Anita. In 2016, Anita lodged a domestic violence complaint against Kamble at Tilak Nagar police station. However, even after the case was filed, things did not improve between them. She filed for divorce. On the day of the incident, the couple was present in court around 2pm, both with their respective relatives, when they got into an argument. A while later, Anita told her parents that she wanted to use the washroom. As she was walking towards it, she felt something pierce her back. She told cops that when she was pulling out the syringe, she was shocked to see her husband nearby, and pushed him. Apprehending trouble, Kamble fled. Kalpana Gadekar, senior inspector, BKC police station, confirmed the development. \u201cWe asked him whose blood was it and Kamble replied that it was extracted from his mother, who is an HIV patient. During interrogation, he told the police that his sister, who has done a nursing course and earlier worked in a Navi Mumbai hospital, had helped collect the blood. We have made her an accused in the case too,\u201d said Gadekar. He was arrested, interrogated and released on bail. Police said they have learnt that in her complaint to Tilak Nagar police, Anita also alleged that Kamble would subject her to unnatural sex. \u201cKamble insisted that if she withdrew her complaint, he would agree to the divorce. She was therefore shocked over the syringe attack,\u201d said an officer. Cops have sent the red liquid for chemical analysis to Kalina forensic science laboratory. She was sent for a medical examination. Cops have reportedly written to Bhabha Hospital, asking them to conduct an advanced test to find if the HIV-positive blood can pose a health risk."

The eye-witness, whose name is being withheld on request, was the first person to respond to Lad\u2019s high-pitched scream before she fell out of the auto late on Friday. Police said the eye-witness, along with the local corporator Usha Bhoir, had rushed to her aid and drove her to the hospital. When he returned to the accident spot, three youths who were riding on a bike, came close to him and demanded to know as to why he rushed to help a stranger. \u201cThese youths appeared very irritated and instead of lauding my rescue efforts they flared up. One of them demanded to know if he was the girls\u2019 relative and what was the motive to rush to her rescue. The trio then sped away,\u2019\u2019 a cop said quoting the eye-witness\u2019 statement. Following media news reports about the incident, the eye-witness recorded his statement with the Kapurbawdi police and informed them about his confrontational meeting with the three still-to-be identified youths. The police promptly summoned a sketch artist from the Mumbai crime branch, who prepared the sketches of the three youths based on the description provided by the eye-witness. The sketch is being circulated to all police stations and sleuths are showing it to their contact sources in the area to identify the trio. The police have already set-up two teams of 24 police personnel who are searching for the suspects in this case. Lad\u2019s is in the hospital and her condition continues to be the same. She is under observation, even five days after she underwent a craniotomy at a private hospital. Meanwhile, local NCP corporator Sanjay Bhoir claimed that such incidents of lone women passengers being harassed by rogue auto rickshaw driver are known in the area. \u201cI have been told quite a few times that the auto drivers from Bhiwandi area would speed away with lone women passengers. They would cross the Balkum area and threaten them to part with money and jewellery. However, not many of these cases were reported,\u2019 Bhoir said.

This would be in addition to the 10 ART centres already existing in the state. This was announced by health minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey here on Thursday. The state government has also decided to give preference in jobs to people with AIDS, while process is also on to provide pension to them. People with AIDS would also be carried free to and fro the ART centres. All these measures were announced on Thursday when a specially designed train, Red Ribbon Express, entered Bihar via Kishanganj district. The train, which will pass through Bihar in two phases, August 23- September 10 and October 13-October 29, would cover 16 districts of Bihar. Red Ribbon Express has special audio-visual systems to create awareness about causes of HIV/AIDS. It also has a condom vending machine, a Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) official said. It was flagged off from New Delhi on January 12 this year. Choubey said there was an urgent need to involve more and more people in creating awareness about AIDS at every level as there is a misconception that it is a contagious disease. It occurs due to unsafe sex, contaminated blood transfusion and from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding, Choubey said, adding involving rural people, particularly youth, in this programme would help create awareness about it. Awareness would also be created at different fairs of the state, including the Sonepur fair, the minister said. There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 50,000 are HIV +. The largest number of HIV+ people are in Patna district. Migration of people from other districts to Patna for treatment has increased the number of HIV positive people in the district, a health department official said. There are 207 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled if they like, Choubey said. \"Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements of HIV/AIDS investigation at every health centre across the state.\""

Yet, he can't be counted among those millions of children who on completing their education, will go into the profession of their choice, become parents and grow old. Varun's case is different because he is HIV positive. At his age and oblivious of his life threatening condition Varun wants to excel in his studies brushing aside the occasional bout of illness. \"I'm studying in class IV,\" he told TOI. His mother Radha corrected him saying, \"He is in class I studying in the English medium.\" Radha came to Goa from Karwar with her two sons to avail of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Varun who had studied up to class IV in the Kannada medium was admitted to class I in a boarding school in Goa where the medium of instruction is English. \"He didn't know English when he came last year but he is catching up fast,\" his proud mother said. Varun might not understand what afflicts him, but thanks to his monthly trips to the ART centre he has sensed that \"something is very wrong with him\". His eyes turn moist and he tries to hide behind his mother when asked \"whether he is sick or if he feels sick\". The ART center at Goa medical college and hospital (GMC) provides ART to about 2,000 HIV persons, including 250-300 children. Dr Vanda Viegas of the ART centre said HIV infected children are also put on ART to protect them from opportunistic infections. \"With good care and intake of nutritional food they can lead a normal life,\" Viegas said. Viegas said that in the absence of any concrete study it is difficult to tell how long a person on ART will live. \"There are no studies done here,\" Viegas said. During the last seven years since the ART centre was started in GMC, at least four children that were on ART have died. Radha tested positive for HIV during her first pregnancy. She knows she got the infection from her husband who died two years ago but accepted it with equanimity. She stays in Margao in a tiny rented premises paying a monthly rent of Rs 600, and takes up odd jobs to support herself and her two sons.

With timely intervention and little help from doctors, they can deliver healthy babies, without passing on the virus. Doctors at AIIMS claim that they have successfully helped HIV positive women to deliver 84 children since June 2004, the highest number in all ygovernment hospitals across the country. Of these, 83 children are healthy and free from HIV infection. One baby died due to early infection. Head of the gynaecology department Dr Suneeta Mittal said 61% of these children were delivered through caesarean procedure as it reduces the chances of infection transmission by one-third. The rest were born through normal delivery. \"We screened more than 10,000 pregnant women admitted at AIIMS under `Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission' programme. Of these, 128 women tested positive for the disease. Fifteen percent opted for termination of the pregnancy while others were operated on and given the required drugs,'' Mittal said. Lalit Kumar, a counsellor at AIIMS, said that 75% of the HIV positive mothers treated by the departments were from the cities, including Delhi. \"There were some cases in which the women were found positive for HIV and the male counterpart tested negative. This led to tension in the family and their relationship was on the verge of breaking. But after the birth of the child, the family was happy,'' said Kumar. The treatment included doses of Nevarapin to the mother during delivery, followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. Except for one child who died within hours of birth as he was infected before the mother reached us, all children are safe and have tested negative for HIV, said Dr Mittal. Out of 84 children born, 47 have completed their periodical tests of 18 months and have tested negative for the infection. \"These children can live a healthy life now. We hope good results for other children too,'' said Dr Mittal. She said that breast feeding can also lead to transmission of HIV infection, so most of the mothers have been advised against it. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), every year, more than 7 lakh children become HIV-positive via transmission from their parents across the world. Some 15-20% are infected during pregnancy, 50% during delivery and 33% through breastfeeding. \"Screening of pregnant women for HIV should be mandatory in all hospitals. This can save"

        "body": "NAGPUR: Sight and vision are not synonymous for them. They seek the latter despite being denied of the former. On Sunday, members of city chapter of Blind Graduates Forum of India (BGFI) got an insight into how to go about this vision. The occasion was a workshop on 'reading without seeing' that introduced the attendees to a few technologies that help them access books, news, electronic communication and much more. It was inaugurated by paediatrician Dr Sunil Bajaj. Trainers from a Mumbai-based Xavier's Resource Centre for Visually Challenged had specially come to demonstrate some of their technologies that could help the visually challenged. On the occasion, Amravati based international swimmer Kanchanmala Pande, who too is totally blind, was the chief guest. She and the other members of the forum spoke about the low social expectations and acceptability of disabled people. Among the technologies showcased were some special applications on computers such as screen readers that speak out the text and magnification software which increase the font. They are useful for people with low vision and OCR readers that can scan the text and read it out. \"Today, we have a range of appliances from thermometers to microwave ovens that have the 'talking' feature. Government calls their efforts to include such technologies in public utilities as 'reasonable accommodation'. Rather than being accommodated, we prefer to say that we are enabling ourselves,\" said Rajesh Assudani, national vice president of BGFI. Kanchanmala, who has won many international awards, uses a tapping device that helps her avoid bumping into people and things while under water. \"It was difficult 10 years ago when I started swimming but now things have become easier. The credit goes to my parents as they always encouraged me,\" she said adding that children suffering from any disability must be supported by their parents so that they become confident and independent. A teacher at an agricultural college at Warora, Ghanshyamdas Assudani, said the apparent attitudinal changes in the society are only at the material level but not mental. \"But it's all right,\" he said, adding, \"Big social changes take time to happen.\" Collegian Rahul Bajaj, who was a topper in both SSC and HSC examinations, however, sees this difference everyday among his friends and classmates. \"Whether it is attending classes or bunking them and hanging out, my friends ensure that I am part of the group. I don't find most people I meet rude or gruff, but I don't like it when they are sympathetic or overprotective,\" he said. Rahul feels this outlook stems from the society's low expectation from people with disabilities. \"Why else would people say they did this despite the disability whenever we accomplish something? Sometimes, I am asked why I want to hang out with my friends when it would be safer at home,\" he said. Assudani sums up the feeling, \"People think that disability means that we are not supposed to find pleasure in activities that 'normal' people do. We are expected to stick to the essentials and leave out the other things.\" Some popular software for visually challenged JAWS (job Access with speech): A computer screen reader that runs on Windows NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access): An open source software for Windows Mobile speak: A software that converts a cell phone to a talking phone to help a person make and receive calls, read and write messages and access many other functionalities of the phone Talks: Software for mobiles, including those with touch screens"

But my child is about to bloom. After all relatives having washed their hands of her care, I don't know how she will live and who will power her dreams and shape her future.\" The state of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) is growing grim, with more than 400 such children waiting for someone to make their lives a bit easier. Ragini is passionate about dancing and whenever the song 'Ata jau dya na ghari' is played, her legs just begin to tap and she loses herself in the music. \"I go to school at Nashik Road. I don't remember my mother, who died when I was one. My father died when I was nine. I know I have the disease, but also know that I can fight it,\" said Ragini. Similar is the fate of 12-year-old visually impaired CLHA, Ankush, who lives in a slum in Satpur. Ankush loves to play the keyboard and other instruments. He lost his father three years back to AIDS and his mother Sangeeta, also HIV positive, is terminally ill. Sangeeta hopes that the government will raise some shelter system for such children. \"Having acquired AIDS from their spouse, women are the worst hit. They lose their husband, their own life and also are unable to see their kids living happily. At least if there is an arrangement for the well-being of the kids, we can be at peace,\" Sangeeta said. The government, on its own part, cannot allow any such facility, as this would mean discriminating against the ill-fated children, who are the victims in this whole vicious circle. \"The government has no scheme to promote a separate facility for HIV positive persons as it would amount to discrimination,\" said a senior official from the health department, adding that instead, the government was ready to fund all the medical aid required by the patients. But such means are found insufficient when it comes to the lives of CLHA, once their parents or grandparents pass away. Mahindra and Mahindra along with Yash Foundation has started an HIV/AIDS awareness programme and is working on the rehabilitation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and support to CLHAs. \"For the last three years, we have been providing nutritional support to more than 150 CLHAs, monitoring their health and even giving them medical support whenever required. But unfortunately, we do not have a residential system for the children,\" said Jitendra Patil, rehabilitation manager, Yash Foundation. This is the time when the need of such arrangement is required the most. In the field of medical inventions, medicos have found solutions such that even HIV-positive parents can give birth to a normal child. \"The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) could serve the purpose by raising an 'educational hostel' facility for the short span of twenty years from today. Here, even normal children could also be admitted. The children could go home during the weekends,\" Patil suggested. Exhibition with a cause Mahindra and Mahindra, along with Yash Foundation is trying to raise funds to help reach more number of CLHAs in the district. In one such drive, they had organized a 'Taarein Zameen Par' programme on January 26, where renowned artists Shivaji Tupe, Anand Sonar and Dnyanesh Belekar from Nashik, with students from the Arts stream created a large number of paintings, which have now been put for auction from April 30 to May 2 at Sadhana Art Gallery, Deepali Nagar, from 11am to 8pm. \"We aim to raise funds for the CLHAs in such a way that we reach the most number of CLHAs in the district,\" Patil said.

        "body": "VARANASI: In order to improve the survival and quality of life of people living with HIV (PLHIV), Banaras Network for Positive People Living (BNPPL) with HIV AIDS Society started a Care and Support Centre, under Vihaan Programme, in consultation with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) recently. Dr Jaya Chakravarty, Dr Preeti and Dr Archana from Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS), Banaras Hindu University (BHU) inaugurated the centre at Durgakund area of the city. BNPPL HIV AIDS Society is run and managed by HIV positive people themselves and has been helping HIV patients to come to lead a healthy and dignified life for over a decade when there was no ART centre for HIV positive people in Uttar Pradesh. The CSC will extend support to HIV positive people in 15 different districts. According to president, BNPPL, Manoj Singh, the main objective of the centre will be to register all the positive people and give counselling to them. It will also be checked that these people are taking regular medicines through ART centres. At the same time, people who have left the treatment will also be connected by carrying out extensive search and will be put on the treatment once again by giving appropriate counselling to them, he informed. According to Dr Jaya Chakravarty from IMS, around 60% of the HIV patients, who are listed under pre-ART at the ART centre of Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), do not revert back or turn up for the regular check-up. \"The pre-ART person often leave the regular check-up out of social stigma or getting indulged in adverse practices of treatment. Such people are the higher risk factor in the society,\" said Manoj. The volunteers of BNPPL will fight against cases of discrimination that surface against positive people in the region alongside helping HIV positive people to come out of the stigma and depression. \"Social stigma and discrimination prevails in the region. Even I was in a terrible shock when I came to know seven years ago that I was HIV positive,\" said Manoj. A 15-member team comprising doctors, social workers, lawyers and others will also be formed to take up the cause of discrimination against HIV patients. \"We will keep a check in district hospital, divisional hospital as well as at health posts, community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centres (PHCs) for such cases. The patients will also be introduced with various welfare schemes of the government which are meant for them,\" he said."

        "title": "HIV scare in Mumbai as funds dry up",
        "body": "MUMBAI: An HIV scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets. Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city\u2019s population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April. This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups. The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include female sex workers (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population. Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families. TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. \u201cOn the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,\u201d said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention. A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust\u2019s buffer to sustain three IDU projects. \u201cThough bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,\u201d he said. Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. \u201cWithout paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,\u201d he said. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said, \u201cThe delay was from NACO\u2019s end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already.\u201d He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India. Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. \u201cThere is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,\u201d he said."

        "body": "TIRUCHI: Several people living with HIV/ AIDS in the state have complained of problems including hallucination and dizziness after the state government changed one of the drugs prescribed to them, non-governmental organisations have said. Doctors said the substitute drug was more effective and problems, if any, would only be temporary. Anti-retrovirals, the drugs of choice for people with HIV/ AIDS, are distributed free of cost at several government hospitals across the state. Usually anti-retroviral therapy comprises the drugs zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. Last month, doctors replaced nevirapine with a drug called efavirenz. Senior district officials said the drug was substituted following a letter from the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. G Karunanidhi, president of HIV Positive Network, said members of his organisation complained of problems after being administered the new drug combination. \"Efavirenz is normally given to people with tuberculosis. In others, it could cause insomnia and tuberculosis resistance. Th government has distributed the drugs to clear stocks,\" said Karunanidhi. Tamil Nadu Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS secretary D Nandha Kumar said they were being needlessly given higher doses of anti-virals. Experts say efavirenz is more expensive and more effective, but need not be given to every patient. \"Efavirenz functions like nevrapine, but it works better,\" says Dr Sunithi Solomon, who heads YRG Care, an NGO working with HIV positive people. \"But if the patient is doing well with nevrapine, there is no reason to change the prescription. The patient may feel dizzy, but soon feel better,\" she said. Social workers are worried that HIV patients complaining of problems with the new drug might drop out of the therapy. \"Patients should have been warned about possible side-effects,\" said a social worker from an NGO in Tiruchi. Doctors said side effects would be temporary. \"Blood tests have found an improvement in the condition of people who were given efavirenz. We will counsel the patients about this,\" said a senior government doctor."

This was revealed from figures available with the Thane district AIDS control programme department. According to the statistics, between December 2007 and October 2014, 23,542 people were detected with HIV, of which 2,178 died. Around 18,557 tested positive were registered for medication, while treatment of 14,000 has already begun. The tests were done after counseling the people at the 40 integrated counseling and treatment centers in the district. Though, the area-wise classification for the last seven years was not available, health officials said most of the cases could be from Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar, going by the block-wise AIDS testing reports for 2013 and 2014. Officials said the positive thing was that more people have started visiting the healthcare centres on their own to get themselves tested. Compared to 86,009 people who got themselves tested in 2010, the numbers shot up to 1,29,046 in 2013, while the first 10 months of 2014 saw 1,59,326 people coming forward for tests. Going by the test reports, officials said there was a dip in the number of people being detected with HIV in the last five years. While 4,570 (5.31%) were tested positive in 2010, the numbers dipped to 3,171 (2.45%) in 2013, while in 2014, till now 2,761 (1.73%) have been tested positive. Activists said there was a need for heightened awareness drives in the district. \u201cThe disease was discovered in the 80s and even after 40 years if so many people are still afflicted, then it poses a question on the efforts taken by the health department,\u201d said activist Nitin Deshpande. Officials working in the AIDS control programme said they will raise awareness levels among people about the disease. \u201cA person can contract HIV while having unprotected sex with an affected partner, sharing contaminated syringes, blood transfusions and deliveries,\u201d said R P Gadhave, district AIDS control department."

The teenager is a thalassemia patient since birth and requires regular blood transfusions. Ravi alleged that his son was tested positive for HIV after he underwent blood tests at another laboratory. \"The complainant said that his son was born at Kashiba Hospital and was diagnosed with thalassemia soon after. He was being treated there and required monthly blood transfusions,\" said Karelibaug police inspector J D Waghela. He added, \"The boy became unwell earlier in January this year and was taken to a clinic in Panigate. He was complaining of severe stomach ache and was not responding to medications. The doctor advised blood tests and it was found that he was HIV positive.\" Authorities of Kashiba Hospital claimed that the infection could not have spread from their facility. \"The hospital has a blood bank of its own and we do not source blood from other banks unless there is an emergency. The hospital duly tests every donor's blood sample before it is stored,\" said superintendent of the hospital Dr Jayant Doshi. \"We have not received any other case of such infection. The police had approached us and we are cooperating with them in every possible way,\" said managing trustee of Kashiba Hospital, Dr Jagdish Patel. Ravi who used to drive a rented auto-rickshaw in the old city area had later taken up a job at Kashiba Hospital. He worked on a contract basis and was relieved of his duties in April this year. \"He was a sanitation worker here and was responsible for cleaning the wards along with the laboratory vessels. The hospital did not employ him directly and is unaware of the reasons leading to his termination,\" said senior administrator of the hospital Panna Desai. The police is yet to file a complaint. \"We are investigating the case and have asked the hospital to submit the boy's complete medical history along with details of the blood transfusions he underwent in the past one year.

Maharashtra has achieved a dubious distinction of registering largest number of people living with HIV after Andhra Pradesh. When the issue of people living with HIV was raised in Parliament, it was informed that out of the 20.88 lakh persons infected with HIV, 4.19 lakh were in Andhra Pradesh, while 3.15 lakh were in Maharashtra, 2.09 lakh in Karnataka, 1.34 lakh in West Bengal, 1.32 lakh in Tamil Nadu, 1.27 lakh in Gujarat and 1.23 lakh in Bihar. The Centre has proposed a budgetary support of Rs 11,394 crore, while Rs 7,314 crore will be spent exclusively on HIV prevention and awareness during the 12th plan period. Gynaecology professor Rekha Dawar said in view of the sudden spurt in HIV cases, the state government has stepped up its health education and awareness plan at all levels across the state. \"It's a fact that Maharashtra has been witnessing increasing number of HIV cases. We will have to further strengthen our action plan,\" she said. Dawar, who has undertaken a number of studies on HIV and AIDS, said, the state government has already intensified targeted intervention plans to halt HIV and AIDS cases. \"Our efforts are on to target mother-to-child infection. We have already initiated a series of measures to tackle the further transmission of the disease,\" she said. Secondly, She said more emphasis is being given in curbing the spread of the menace among migrant workers, truck drivers and commercial sex workers. \"We will have to concentrate on the migrant population, truck drivers and commercial sex workers. More emphasis will have to be given on safe sex and educate people on the ill-effects of unsafe intercourse,\" she said. A senior public health official said, a few years ago, states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West Bengal were on the top, but over a period of time, Maharashtra has achieved the dubious distinction of leading the list with largest number of HIV cases. \"We have the maximum number of health workers and paramedical staff, despite such a situation, Maharashtra has been witnessing a steady increase in the number of HIV cases.

        "body": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) for the first time has recommended HIV self-testing in the privacy of one's home using HIV kit, a move that may result in a major breakthrough in HIV treatment by improving access to diagnosis. Though India now does not allow HIV self-test, the UN agency's guidance has even prompted the health ministry here to evaluate the proposal. \u201cWe will certainly look at WHO's recommendations and evaluate how it can be adopt ed,\u201c said C K Mishra, secretary to the health ministry. The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease. Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally , around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status. Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice. HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less.Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services. A senior official said, India may initially adopt the UN agency's suggestions for self-testing among high risk communities where the incidence and chances of spread is higher. \u201cMillions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others,\u201c said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO. \u201cHIV selftesting should open the door for many more people to know their HIV status and find out how to get treatment and access prevention services.\u201c Estimates by National Aids Control Organization, which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 2.2 crore people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. In 2015, the total number of people living with HIV in India were estimated at 21.17 lakh, whereas 86,000 new cases were found.Though incidence of HIV in India has declined substantially since 2000 by around 66%, lack of accessibility to testing and the stigma attached to HIV poses a challenge for uptake of HIV diagnosis."

Apart from urging the government to pass the revised Manipur State AIDS Policy, 2010, in the ongoing assembly session, the memo sought to make all entitlement schemes and benefits available to PLHIVs. The memo urged the government to ensure that laboratory testing and investigations for HIV/AIDS patients be made free of cost in all government hospitals and Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres. This would include treatment for opportunistic infections and related illnesses like hepatitis C. The NGOs also demanded that basic amenities such as drinking water, sanitation and seating arrangements at all ART centres should be provided to PLHIVs. Manipur is one of India's six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states. According to the latest report prepared by Manipur State AIDS Control Society (Macs), the state has 43,707 PLHIVs. Of this number, 11,878 are women and 2,780 are children. As a result of the government's failure to implement such measures, PLHIVs face acute challenges in accessing basic healthcare, supportive medicine, food, education and housing. The memo highlighted the increasing poverty levels among Manipur's HIV positive community and stated that increasing prices was a major threat to the infected population as it decreased access to basic commodities. The NGOs demanded the appointment of adequate doctors in government hospitals to deal with HIV cases, especially gynecologists for female PLHIVs. Increasing accessibility of ART at treatment centres and installing and improving CD4 count and viral load testing machines at such centers were some of their other demands. The memo, a copy of which was forwarded to Manipur speaker Th Lokeshwar Singh, health minister Phungzathang Tonsing, social welfare minister A K Mirabai Devi and MLA I Ibohalbi Singh, stated that the NGOs had earlier put forward their demands to the government, but in vain."

When a pregnant woman comes to hospital for institutional delivery, the hospital conducts a test for HIV/AIDS. If the woman is tested positive, the hospital administer medicines which reduces the chances of transmission of HIV from mother to child.\u201d The officials of the medical and health department gave figures of people living with AIDS, challenges in uprooting the disease, precautions and reasons for its spread."

        "body": "NAGPUR: The twelfth five year plan may have special support for the HIV-positive women and children. Women living with HIV/AIDS may also get priority at government shelter homes. This is among the measures being proposed by women and child development (WCD) department of the government of India. Vandana Jena, adviser to the WCD in planning commission shared this information after a formal launch of country's second Women Resource Centre (WRC) in city at India Peace Centre. The centre has been set up with the help of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). First WRC was set up at Ajmer. Jena said that every district may have one such shelter home. Women with no shelter like destitute women, Dalit women, and widows can seek shelter here through a national helpline to be created for the purpose. Priority will also be given to HIV-positive women in these homes. In fact, government is also contemplating support for 'women in conflict areas' like those affected by left extremists. WRCs are aimed at linking all the different government welfare schemes to the women and children living with HIV/AIDS. The Positive Women Network (PWN), an NGO working for HIV-positive women in country in 13 states at present, is the force behind the centre. The funds for the centre come from UNDP. These women generally become widows at a very early age. Since they are afraid of disclosing their HIV status openly, they cannot avail the benefits of various social welfare projects and schemes. WRC will work for bringing these schemes to the positive women by helping them with documentation and follow up procedures to get the benefits faster. Umesh Chawla from UNDP said that problems of women living with HIV/AIDS were compounding. WRC would act as a link between the social protection schemes of the government and affected women. Akhila Sivadas from the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) lauded the efforts of the pioneer of such women's cause, P Kousalya, president of PWN which has helped about 28,000 women so for in various ways. She said that Kousalya is the living testimony of the struggle such women undergo. \"The dynamics of government working do not allow people to champion the cause of such women. But Kousalya has proved it otherwise with her dedication, sincerity and above all her daring to face the highest officials in planning commission and seek intervention for PWN members,\" she said. She also lauded Cyantha Shinde for taking over the responsibility as WRC coordinator for the city. Dr Ravi Wankhede, director of Jeevan Jyoti Blood Bank, Dr Milind Bhrushandi, Dr Praveen Dahake and Smita Pawanikar, district women and child welfare officer, were also present. Defying adversity, helping a cause Nagpur: Disregarding the consequences, she went ahead and declared in public her HIV-positive status way back in 1995. In fact, she was the first HIV-positive woman to admit her status before the media. P Kousalya, now president of the Positive Women Network (PWN), became a widow at the age of 19 after just seven months of marriage. Instead of losing heart, she championed the cause of women like her. Kousalya shared her journey from her initial plight of not getting the right treatment and drugs to her present achievement of seeing her dream of starting Women Resource Centres (WRCs) for women and children living with HIV/AIDS with TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the centre in city. \"My mother had decided to marry me to my husband when both of us were child. He was a truck driver and knew he was infected with HIV just a few days before our marriage. He did not share it with me and passed the infection to me. Although I studied till Standard XII, I didn't know anything about the disease. I even went to quacks,\" said Kousalya describing her journey from Namakkal, a town in Tamil Nadu infamous for high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Looking back, she says she realized what good her family did to her and society at large by letting her share her HIV status. It was a blessing in disguise for women like me. \"Now I can stand face to face with authorities and demand our rights. Initially, I had to face a lot of hardship as I was thrown out of such platforms. But now I am a part of not just national but also international forums working for the cause. Yet we still have a long way to go,\" she said."

        "body": "A British man could become the first person in the world to be cured of HIV using a new therapy designed by a team of scientists from five UK universities. The therapy is combining standard antiretroviral drugs with another one that reactivates dormant HIV and a vaccine that induces the immune system to destroy the infected cells. Antiretoviral drugs alone are highly effective at stopping the virus from reproducing but do not eradicate the disease, so must be taken for life. The 44-year-old Briton is the first among 50 people to complete a trial of the treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London and King's College. Early tests show no signs of the virus in his blood, the Sunday Times reported. If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for millions of people infected with the virus. But the person will have to wait for some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease. It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease. \u201cMy last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus,\u201c the patient said. HIV is able to hide from the immune system in dormant cells where sophisticated testing cannot find it, and therefore resist therapy . The treatment endeavours to trick the virus into emerging from its hiding places and then trigger the body's immune system to recognise it and attack it, an approach that has been called \u201ckick and kill\u201c. The new therapy works in two stages. Firstly ,a vaccine helps the body recognise the HIV-infected cells so it can clear them out. Secondly, a new drug called Vorinostat activates the dormant Tcells so they can be spotted by the immune system."

        "body": "Swaziland's King Mswati III called his male subjects to get circumcised as he endorsed a campaign aimed at tackling the world's highest HIV infection rate. Flanked by a large royal contingent including his mother, who rules alongside him, four of his 13 wives and several children, Africa's last absolute monarch said men and boys needed to get circumcised to help fight the \"terrorist\" virus, which infects one in four adults in the kingdom of nearly 1.2 million. Studies have found men without a foreskin are 60% less likely to get HIV, the virus that can lead to AIDS. \"It seems fitting that our men and young boys should be given an initiative that will help them fight this disease,\" Mswati told a gathering of thousands in the southern town of Mankayane, where he gave his official endorsement to the campaign. \"This virus I shall liken to a terrorist. It is here to finish off our people.\" Mswati was entertained by bare-breasted teenage girls, troops of warrior regiments and a military brass band. Urging his nation to \"take care of your lives - stay away from activities that could give you the disease,\" the king struck a very different note from his pronouncement to parliament a decade ago that HIV-positive people should be \"branded and sterilized\". The US-funded circumcision campaign aims to snip 80% of Swazi males aged 14 to 49 within a year. Officials hope to avert 90,000 new infections and save the health system millions of dollars over the next decade. Circumcision used to be widespread in Swaziland, but was abandoned in the 19th century. The king likened the return of the practice to other traditions he revived in 2001 as a solution to the rampant epidemic: requiring young girls to wear tassels to display their virginity and banning men from having sex with girls under 18. When the king broke his own ban by taking a 17-year-old wife, he fined himself a cow. Since the project started six months ago, results have not been encouraging. Only 3,000 have braved the scalpel despite a massive advertising campaign. Organizers are pinning their hopes on Mswati, known to his people as \"the mouth that speaks no lies\", to breathe life into the campaign."

One of 17 convicts in this case, whose punishment of life imprisonment was upheld by the high court in last October, has filed a petition in the high court seeking directions to the Sabarmati Central Jail authorities to follow a state government circular issued in 2013 to consider granting remission to a prisoner in cases of HIV/AIDS and cancer. Petitioner\u2019s advocate Nisarg Shah said that the convict suffers from HIV infection since 2009. This is the third occasion on which the convict has raised the issue of remission before jail authorities. When his application was not considered for the first time, he moved the high court which directed the jail authorities and the state government to take a decision on the issue within stipulated time. However, officials did not take any decision on the convict\u2019s representation. The convict made applications twice again, but failed to get any response. This led him to move the HC once again. After issuing notice to the state government and the jail superintendent , Justice J B Pardiwala has kept further hearing in June. Thirty-three persons, mostly women and children, were burnt alive in a room locked from outside by a violent mob in north Gujarat village of Sardarpura on March 1, 2002. In 2011, a special SIT court convicted 31 persons and handed down life imprisonment to them. Last year, Gujarat high court upheld conviction for 17 persons, whereas it acquitted 14 others."

Her husband died on the way to the hospital. The 35-year-old woman from Huruha village in Dharmanagar has developed a multiple-organ disorder. The couple had consumed pesticide on October 24 to get rid of social humiliation. The couple was diagnosed with HIV around three years ago during a blood test when the woman was five-month pregnant. Following doctors' advice, the woman had terminated her pregnancy immediately. The couple was allegedly ostracized by their family members, relatives and neighbours over the last three years. \"I was infected from my husband after we got married in 2008, but I had accepted it as my fate and decided to live together. We didn't have any problem in our marital life, except family members, relatives disgracing us every now and then,\" she told the media in the hospital. The humiliation crossed all limits when their relatives started abusing them in public. The situation turned worse on October 23 when her in-laws decided to throw them out of the village apprehending further spread of the disease if they continued to stay in the locality. \"We decided to take the extreme step and die together to save ourselves from further social and family isolation. Ever since the diagnosis, there have been a lot of medical complications, but our mental agony was far worse. Instead of any moral support, our families rejected us. It was very difficult for us to carry on,\" she said. Her husband had admitted that he was the carrier, she said. With the intervention of the Tripura AIDS Control Society, the couple had joined a network of HIV positive people in the state. Despite humiliation from family members and neighbours, the couple lived a normal life following counseling sessions and assistance from the society. In fact, the man was very popular among a group of 1,600 HIV- positive people. The members had even decided that he would be made the next secretary of the group, an official of the society said. \"We have asked police to take steps against the family members because what they have done is a serious crime. Our counsellors held a number of sessions with the family members and tried to convince them that the couple needed their support, instead of isolation,\" a senior official of the society said. SP (North) Abhijit Saptarshi said, \"We have recorded the testimony of the woman. She is recovering now.\""

        "body": "KOLKATA: A 34-year-old HIV Positive widow and mother of two was ostracized, assaulted and thrown out of her Dakshineswar home by neighbours under the alleged instruction of the husband of a local Trinamool Congress councillor. She and her children have been rendered homeless for the last two weeks with the administration choosing to look the other way till rights activists took up the matter and brought it to media glare on Saturday. Earlier, local people had allegedly drove her husband to commit suicide by taunting him repeatedly for his HIV Positive status and threatening eviction. A \u201cnexus\u201d between local landsharks, the councillor\u2019s husband and the former land owner of the house allegedly conspired to evict the woman by instigating neighbours to banish the \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d woman from the area. She and her children were dragged out of the house on November 23 and the door was padlocked. The trio has since been spending the nights either at a railway platform or with relatives who allowed them only one night\u2019s stay. The woman has been running from pillar to post in search of help from the administration, only to be refused everywhere. \u201cI told police officials everything and requested them to make an arrangement for my children and me to return home. But, nobody took the matter seriously. With my emergency medicines lying in the locked home, I tried to gain entrance to access them but was threatened, abused and assaulted, which forced me to leave the spot,\u201d the widow told TOI while recounting her horror story on Saturday. It was only after she managed to get in touch with activists of South 24-Parganas Network for People Living with HIV+, a non-government organization, that she received some support. Members of the NGO accompanied her to Belghoria police station and lodged a complaint. The woman also met the North 24-Parganas district magistrate on Friday and sought her intervention. The widow lived in a house on Abbas Ali Lane, Dakshineswar, with her two sons. The elder one is 14-year-old and studies in Class IX, while the younger one is six-year-old and a student of Class II. The house is in ward No. 13 of Kamarhati Municipality. Her husband, who was a grocer, had committed suicide in May after being hounded by neighbours following the HIV Positive diagnosis during tests prior to a brain tumor operation. The woman was thereafter asked to undergo a check and she too tested positive. \u201cAfter the initial shock, I took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counselling at RG Kar Hospital. I decided to keep my condition under wraps when doctors said we could lead a normal life under medication and care. I looked forward to life as my two sons were not infected. But, my husband could not take the torture by neighbours and committed suicide on May 17,\u201d the widow recounted. The woman\u2019s ordeal took a turn for the worse with former land owner Amit Das, Laltu Bose (husband of Mithu Bose, the TMC councillor of ward No. 13 of Kamarhati Municipality) and their associates allegedly driving the family out of the house. The victim\u2019s husband had purchased the 1.5 cottah land from Das and constructed a single-storey house there. \u201cThe local councilor\u2019s husband and his associates threatened and abused us as well. We knocked on the doors of several administration officials, including local police officers, SDO and DM, seeking action against the accused. But nothing has happened till now,\u201d said Sebika Chowdhury, co-coordinator of the NGO. Khitish Mondal, the president of the NGO who took the woman to the DM\u2019s office, said, \u201cWe could not meet the DM. But his secretary assured us of action.\u201d Laltu Bose, the husband of the councilor, refuted the allegation leveled against him and launched a tirade against the woman, accusing her character. \u201cI was falsely implicated,\u201d Bose said. Kamarhati MLA and transport minister Madan Mitra said, \u201cI have asked to the Kamarhati Municipality chairman to give a detailed report in this connection.\u201d DC-DD of Barrackpore commissionerate Ajay Thakur said, \u201cWe are looking into the matter seriously.\u201d"

        "title": "Only 21% of HIV positive transgenders, 33% of sex workers have access to treatment",
        "body": "BENGALURU: Almost two-thirds of the transgenders in India have no access to treatment of sexually transmitted infections, says a recent study by medical journal Lancet. The situation is no better in Karnataka, with only 21% of the HIV positive transgenders and 33% of the infected female sex workers undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, according to the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS). Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 (Thursday), TOI found that of the 6,756 HIV-infected female sex workers in the state, only 2,257 are benefitting from anti-retroviral therapy. Similarly, of the 175 transgenders with HIV, only 37 are being treated. This despite the HIV Bill introduced in 2014 \u2014 it was amended this year \u2014 which makes anti-retroviral therapy (it can enhance longevity) a legal right for all HIV patients. \u201cA recent study conducted by Swasti for the United Nations Development Programme revealed that often doctors refuse to treat individuals from the transgender community. They are either ignored or are shown the door by doctors, who say they don\u2019t know how to treat them,\u201d said Shama Karkal, director, Avahan \u2013 Swasti, a health resource centre that works with the transgender community, sex workers and gay men. The study covered transgenders in five states \u2014 Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The study showed that even transgenders are hesitant about getting themselves tested for HIV, though hospitals provide the facility. \u201cThere is an assumption that only those who are sexually active or sexually promiscuous need to get the test done. Transgenders are judged not only by hospital staff but also their peers,\u201d she added. Highlighting the distress of female sex workers, thoracic surgeon and director of SDS Tuberculosis Research Centre and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi, said: \u201cWe cannot expect others to stop discriminating against sex workers if the doctor community itself is biased. The harsh reality is despite being aware of the nature of HIV virus, the medical fraternity often chooses not to treat an infected patient. The stigma is even more deep-rooted when the patient happens to be a sex worker.\u201d Stating that numbers don\u2019t depict the real picture, Dr Buggi explained: \u201cThe existence of prevention societies is not enough to bring about a positive change in the health condition of sex workers, as the ground reality is different from what\u2019s there on paper. There is no proper retrieving system in place, with no one to assess the work of these organizations and question their accountability. Most of the cases these organizations record are under-reported.\u201d Demonetization a hindrance The recent demonetization policy has only added to the plight of transgenders as far as treatment is concerned. \u201cIt has become very difficult to meet medical and travel expenses. I recently had to undergo a uterus operation, which was an expensive procedure. The tests and follow-up visits have drilled a hole in my pocket and scrapping of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has only made it worse,\u201d said Usha, an HIV positive transgender. Manta, another transgender who\u2019s a sex worker, said: \u201cI am HIV positive but I have learnt to take care of my health. However, after demonetization, my income has drastically reduced. Either the clients don\u2019t pay or they hand over high denomination notes. Either way, I am left with no money.\u201d Social hierarchy a barrier Another study on transgenders revealed that social hierarchical systems play a major role in deciding which healthcare services an individual can access. Every decision vests with the guru. The study found that 12.3% of the community members opted for informal surgeries conducted by someone from the community or the guru as opposed to formal services provided in hospitals. Any transgender who goes against the guru has to face discrimination"

The new centres would come up at Bharatpur, Jhunjhunu, Barmer, Dungarpur, Nagaur and Jalore. The NACO has approved Rs 32 crore for preventing new infections, care support and treatment, institutional strengthening and strategic management information system. Last year too, NACO had approved almost an equal amount for the state. Barmer, Dungarpur, Nagaur and Jalore were identified by the NACO last year for ART centres but due to certain reasons, these centres could not be opened, a health official said. Besides, the Centre has directed the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) that four ART centres from previous years annual action plan need to be made functional. The work for construction of ART centres in the four districts has been completed and they would be opened soon. There are 10 existing ART centres in the state - in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Udaipur, Kota, Ajmer, Alwar, Pali, Bhilwara and Sikar. As per the department's figures, out of the total people living with HIV, who started ART, 12,488 are alive and currently on ART. Jaipur district shows the maximum number of people living with HIV ever started ART with 7,800 patients till March 2012. In Jodhpur, there are 5,579 and in Udaipur 3,930 people living with HIV are on ART.

        "body": "SOLAPUR: Throughout her childhood, 14-year-old Mona would overhear terms such as \u2018HIV\u2019 and \u2018AIDS\u2019 uttered in hushed tones at her Solapur house. The mystery ended two years ago when her mother succumbed to AIDS following a ten-year battle. Her bedridden father, also afflicted by the virus, broke the news to her just a day later. \u201cIt\u2019s a germ in our blood that will stay with us forever. It has not spared you either,\u201d says Mona, recalling her father\u2019s words. The revelation, she vividly remembers, was followed by a directive to keep it a secret. More than the disease, it was the secrecy that instilled a deep sense of shame. Similarly, Pandharpur native Sundari (13) barely had time to cope with her father\u2019s death when she was told about her HIV status. That was the first time her grandfather told her that it was AIDS that killed her parents. Unable to bear the ill-treatment meted out to her by the extended family, the grandfather put her in an orphanage, where she presently lives. Studies have underlined the criticality of disclosure\u2014telling someone about their HIV status\u2014in fighting the disease and how, when done under tragic circumstances and without counselling, it can damage the way an HIV-infected child or an adolescent view themselves for the rest of their lives. The lack of a holistic framework in India has left parents, caregivers and institutions grappling to find the right approach. Several children discover the ailment accidentally or at the time of losing a parent; many come to know when they are being discriminated against, or worse, after they have been sexually abused. The complex questions of \u2018how to tell\u2019 and \u2018when to tell\u2019 is simply passed over at Pune-based Manavya, one of the oldest homes in Maharashtra to care for HIV positive children. The caretakers never let out the \u201csecret\u201d even as they teach every child how to take medicines and fight the disease. \u201cIf they have questions about HIV, we answer them scientifically,\u201d said Shirish Lawate, trustee of Manavya. Children as young as five start questioning their daily medications. \u201cWe tell them it\u2019s to kill the jantu (organism) inside their body,\u201d says Sushma Apte, one of the coordinators. Visits to hospitals and ART centres seem to be one of the common ways children discover their HIV status. Fifteen-year-old Sushila says, \u201cI figured I had HIV by looking at posters at Solapur Civil Hospital. But it took me a while to understand there are ways other than physical relationships to get HIV,\u201d she says. The teenager is from Palawi in Pandharpur, a residential institution run by Mangaltai Shah and her daughter Dimple Ghadge that provides shelter to 110 HIV children. Ghadge says counselling at state-run ART centres is perfunctory. \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps the reason why mental health issues, particularly depression, mood swings and anger is rampant among them,\u201d says Ghadge. Chinmayi Modi, a member of the National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+), adds that the incidence of suicides among HIV-affected youth is high but there is no verifiable data. At the Bandra-based CCDT, for in-house residents older than 10-12 years, the disclosure is done gradually keeping the child\u2019s maturity in mind. It\u2019s when families are involved, says programme director Poonam DSouza, that it becomes challenging. \u201cAll parents want to delay it till their children are in late teens,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we discourage late disclosures since children at that age start having relationships and should be aware of the risks of unsafe sex,\u201d she adds. Brahmadev from Vihaan, an NGO working for HIV, says it\u2019s common for children to blame parents, run away from home and stop taking medicines. Unlike practices worldwide, where a lot of thought goes into disclosing a child\u2019s HIV status, no structure exists here, says Shabana Patel, president of Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+). \"The first counselling when a child starts ART is crucial and should last for a minimum of 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen even for 5 minutes,\" says Patel. In Maharashtra, there is one counsellor for every 300 HIV patients. Parimal Singh, who heads Maharashtra State Aids Control Society, said a methodology is being drawn up to ensure those who have adherence issues don't miss out on quality counselling. Mumbai\u2019s Sion Hospital has developed some tools for this purpose. Counsellor Laxman Jamkhandi uses storytelling to educate his young patients. White cells vital to the immune system assume the role of good soldiers that need the aid of weapons like ART drugs and nutrition to kill the black demon virus. \u201cA superhero story never fails to get the attention of children,\" he says. \"With better ART, children are surviving for decades, so it's better their body and mind starts accepting it early.\u201d"

In a bid to help the man, additional district magistrate Shailendra Kumar Singh and CMO Jai Singh ordered to provide him the required treatment. The officials also directed hospital authorities to get him tested for AIDS. While commenting on the misbehaviour of LLR doctors, the ADM said jurisprudence had lagged behind technological and scientific advances and remained somewhat distant from the medical arena. \"Consequently, it is necessary to establish boundaries between medicine and law, taking into consideration the principles of medical ethics in the legislative sphere,\" he said. \"It is vary sad that even after so much awareness people treat suspected AIDS patient in such a way, and that too their own family member,\" CMO Jai Singh said."

        "body": "LONDON: AIDS that kills 2.1 million people every year globally can be contained within just five years by testing everybody in high-risk regions and providing immediate treatment for those found to be HIV positive, a leading scientist has claimed. According to Dr Brian Williams of the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (Sacema), once the testing is done, an aggressive treatment programme would not only save millions of lives but would also prevent transmission of HIV that affects over 33 million people worldwide annually. But, Dr Williams said, the universal therapy with anti-retroviral drugs could prove to be the most promising way of controlling a disease. It also has the potential to halve tuberculosis infections associated with HIV and AIDS. \"It would be enough to stop transmission and make most people effectively not infectious to others,\" Dr Williams, a former WHO epidemiologist who still advises the United Nations body, was quoted as saying by the Sunday Times. \"The question is can we use anti-retroviral drugs not only to keep people alive but also to stop transmission? I believe that we can,\" Dr Williams said. \"I believe that if we use them effectively we could stop transmission within five years.\u201d \"Treating people with ART within one year of becoming infected would reduce transmission by about ten times, each person with HIV would infect, on average, less than one other person, and the epidemic would die out.\""

        "body": "MUMBAI: The HIV/AIDS infection has seen a drastic decline among the general population of Mumbai, and new infections too have come down significantly. However, Mumbai's dream to be counted as one of the cities with lesser prevalence of HIV still remains a distant one. The city's AIDS control body, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), has collated figures for the last four years and concluded that the prevalence of the virus has come down from 10.65% in 2007 to 7.69% in 2010 (till May) among the general population. For pregnant women too, the decline has been from 0.91% to 0.58% during the same period. Authorities attribute the decline to increased awareness among youth. \"It is the combined effect of awareness and our targeted interventions. Our biggest victory has been to prevent new infections,'' said project director of MDACS, Dr S S Kudalkar. The MDACS studied the data from 74 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in the city. He added the percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women in the city used to be about 1.4 till four years ago, which has now come down to 0.5. \"Also, infection due to blood transfusions is down from 0.8% to about 0.4% in the same period,'' he said. The MDACS now hopes that the sentinel surveillance by the National AIDS Control Organisation, which begins in October, will give a thumbs up to Mumbai's war against HIV. MDACS has realised that taking Mumbai from category A to category B for HIV prevalence remains a daunting task. Category A is defined as any district where the number of pregnant women testing positive at ante-natal clinics in high risk areas is over 1% in the last three years. For Mumbai to be counted as category B, the number of pregnant women testing positive at these centres should be less than 1%. \"Also, the city should have lesser number of hotspots like brothels,'' said a civic official. \"It will be at least a decade for Mumbai to make it category B,'' said the official.

        "body": "BHAVNAGAR (Gujarat): Three young HIV positive sisters from the coastal village of Khadsaliya, about 25km from Bhavnagar, ended their lives by drinking pesticide on Friday night. Preliminary investigation suggests that the family members felt stigmatized due to their disease. The police said that the mother and brother of the deceased had died of AIDS four years ago. And sources said that whenever the sisters ventured out occasionally, they were treated as untouchables. \"We will investigate whether the stigma forced them to take this extreme step,\" investigating officer J R Zala of Vartej police station said. Krushnaben (16), Rekhaba (12) and Dakshaba (10) were daughters of a marginal farmer Vinubha Gohil, who is also HIV positive. The family lived in an isolated house in a small orchard on the outskirts of the village, where they had two bighas (12 acres) of land. The sisters consumed pesticide around 11pm on Friday when they were alone at home. By the time their father arrived the situation had become critical. He informed other family members and an ambulance was called though Rekhaba and Dakshaba had died. Krushnaben died at a hospital in Bhavnagar. A senior officer at the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society, Gandhinagar, said that the youngest of the three sisters, Dakshaba, was HIV negative. \u201cIt is a tragic incident as we had the family registered but the father had developed a false perception that the medicines were harmful as his wife had died during treatment. Her infection was detected at the last stage,\u201d said the official. \u201cVinubha Gohil even threatened to attack our workers who went to persuade him to take treatment. He is one of the 59,000 HIV postive patients registered with us,\u201d he said. Official sources said that there are 1,200 HIV positive patients registered in Bhavnagar district. \u201cWe are investigating the matter as the patients were registered with us,\u201d Dr B N Vyas, district programme officer of an HIV/Aids government initiative said."

The application on the Nevirapine extended release formulation was refused since it was found to be \u201cobvious\u201d and lacking inventive step, violating Section 3 (d) of the Indian Patent Act \u2014 a provision under which Novartis lost the patent on its blockbuster drug Glivec in 2013. Simply put, Viramune XR was found to be merely a new form of something already known, without demonstration of any enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Section 3(d) \u2014 an important safeguard in the patent law specifically relevant for pharma and chemical industries \u2014 prohibits grant of patents to new forms of known substances, unless the new form results in enhanced efficacy over the known substance. The MNC had applied for a patent in India on the extended release of the HIV drug in July 2009, on which domestic company Cipla filed a pre-grant opposition in 2011, and later launched its generic version. The application was examined by the Indian Patent Office, which raised objections in its examination report in January 2014 over obviousness and Section 3(d). The German company filed a response through its agents Remfry & Sagar. Cipla then filed a pre-grant opposition through S Majumdar & Co. Boehringer did not respond to a query sent out by TOI.\u201cThe applicant (Boehringer) did not respond to the pre-grant opposition and also did not appear at the hearing fixed for the same on September 15, 2015,\u201d legal sources told TOI. N R Meena, deputy controller of Patents & Designs, said in the order, a copy of which was accessed by TOI, since the applicant did not appear in the hearing fixed under section 25(1) before the controller, and no arguments were offered to rebut the objections raised in the FER (first examination report), and by the opponent, therefore the application for grant of patent is refused."

        "title": "Top city hospital made me HIV+ve, alleges 40-yr-old",
        "body": "A little over two years ago, when 40-year-old Gowri (name changed), married for nearly 15 years and childless, got admitted to MS Ramaiah Hospital for a surgical procedure to remove uterus fibroids, she hoped to be a mother soon. She went through the mandatory blood tests before surgery and everything was fine barring a low haemoglobin level. A blood transfusion done at the hospital to improve her platelet count, however, changed the course of her life for the worse.Though she was not operated upon in that period, she was given one unit of blood and asked to come back in five days by which time the Hb percentage was expected to improve. What followed came as a total shock. Subsequently, when Gowri came back for admission and after another round of blood tests, the results said: Reactive to HIV 1. And the interpretation was screaming: \"The above sample was repeatedly reactive for HIV I and II antibodies by three different test methods and therefore positive for HIV as per NACO guidelines.\"The family was caught unawares. Not even a week prior to this second blood test, her sample showed HIV negative, in the same laboratory, of the same hospital. The hospital, which denied the allegations, reportedly told the family that Gowri was already infected before she came to them. It's been two years since her diagnosis and Gowri is on medication; her family has approached the Karnataka Medical Council and is fighting a case in the magistrate's court. The issue was brought before the state health department, and a committee was formed, but it did not see any action. A petition moved by V S Ugrappa, chairman of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children, has set the ball rolling with the police taking up the case.The complaint was filed recently at Sadashivnagar police station against the hospital, a gynaecologist, and two employees of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center for cognisable offence of \"forgery with medical records and medical negligence\".\"It is submitted that the accused hospital is involved in gross medical negligence by causing HIV infection via contaminated blood transfusion. Thereafter, the accused have tampered with the medical records to cover up the crime. The chain of events shows that within all human probability, the offence of forgery of medical records to conceal evidence of medical negligence. This complaint may be specially taken in record and speedily acted upon, because of the gravity of the crime, the maneuvers of the other side to hush up matters and cause great harm to me and my family,'' the complaint has stated.The major offences recorded are: Forgery of medical record (IPC section 466); cheating (420); forgery (463), making a false document (464). Subsequently, the police have taken up an FIR and investigations are on -- they are examining the medical records and have questioned the hospital staff and the doctor.Documents show that on February 13, 2014, Gowri was admitted to the hospital and discharged on the 15th. Her discharge summary says that her Hb% is 7.5m, platelet count 2.29; VDRL, HIV I & II negative and one unit of blood transfusion was advised. Accordingly, on the 14th, one unit (300 ml of RBC) was given (blood unit number 17093 for which the family has the record) and on the 15th she was discharged and asked to come back on the 19th.Subsequently, on February 19, Gowri was again admitted and the same set of blood tests were carried out. And this time the results were: Hb% 10.2, platelet count 2.23 and HIV I & II negative (in fact it is very unclear and looks like a scribble). The discharge summary read: \"Patient came with the above mentioned complaints, diagnosed to be Retro Positive and counseling done. Hence discharged on February 22.'' Surprisingly, the blood unit number was changed to 12093 in the hospital records.The patient gave another sample for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center on February 24 which also showed her positive for HIV. Intriguingly, the same Center has another record to show that on February 12, Gowri's sample was tested and came back HIV positive. But the catch is that Gowri was admitted to MS Ramaiah only on February 13, hence where did this blood test come from. The family sees something amiss. \"This is a fraudulent document. When my sister was admitted on 13th and her blood sample drawn for testing at MS Ramaiah, why would she go for blood tests on the 12th? This document was created subsequently to show that the patient was infected before she was admitted. But the hospital's first discharge summary says that the blood tests are negative for HIV. This has to be investigated thoroughly,'' said the patient's husband Rajanna (name changed).MS Ramaiah Hospital termed the issue an \"allegation\" and its chief administrator Dr V Narendranath, who did not want to divulge much on the case, said, \"It is in court and it is sub judice. We will respond to the court and give a reply to the appropriate authority. We respect our patients and we cannot divulge the patient's medical history. We will not breach the patient's confidentiality at any cost.\" Expressing his resentment over the police \"harassing the doctors and para-medical staff for four days\", Dr Narendranath says: \"Why is this a criminal case? These days, hospitals have become a soft target. Every patient has a right to express his/her grievance and somebody has to decide what is right and what is wrong.\" Why the mess?For a start, MS Ramaiah Hospital doesn't come under the state government's Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID-NAT) project where blood is tested at the highest standard. The normal process followed for testing of donated blood in private blood banks in hospitals is the Elisa test, which detects Hepatitis B and C and HIV for antigens and antibodies. However, under ID-NAT, the blood sample is tested for HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C) to detect direct Ribo Nucleic Acid and DNA of the virus. All government hospital bloodbanks and Rotary-TTK are a part of this project where donated blood is mandatorily tested by ID-NAT. This test is done at Bowring Hospital, the only certified blood testing facility.According to specialists, a virus, after entering the bloodstream, has a window period and only after that can the antigens or antibodies be detected. HIV has a lower window period than HBV or HCV -- around 15-20 days. In case an HIV-infected person donates blood and the window period is just four to five days, the virus will go undetected and there is a fair chance that it could infect the person undergoing the blood transfusion."

The study, conducted by the BMC along with MSF and published in medical journal PLoS One, last week, reveals that the proportion of drug-resistant TB was 25% among new cases of TB and 44% among previously treated TB cases. \u201cThe study provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB (drug-resistant) in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients,\u201d said the MSF release. These patients were exposed to DR-TB mycobacterium either in their communities or during their visits to health facilities as they have no previous records of receiving treatment for TB. The study\u2019s co-author Dr Arun Bamne, who was the city\u2019s executive health officer until recently, said such studies give insight into the TB load among marginalised populations and help shape specific health intervention programmes. The study was conducted among HIV-positive people attending seven ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres. More than 14,000 visits were studied, and sputum of 1,724 patients with TB symptoms was collected. The study was released to coincide with the Union World Conference on Lung Health which begins in Barcelona later this week. \u201cThe findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB (drug resistant), especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission,\u201d said the MSF press release. \u201cWe need to urgently prevent transmission of DR-TB to others. With DR-TB, treatment is prevention, and these findings should lead to a stronger focus on diagnostics and treatment of DR-TB, particularly in high HIV-prevalent settings,\u201d said Eldred Tellis of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. The study says there is a need to promptly diagnose drug-resistance among all HIV-infected people by systematically offering access to first- and second-line drug-sensitivity testing to patients with \u2018presumptive TB\u2019 rather than \u2018presumptive DR-TB\u2019 and tailor treatment regimen based on the resistance patterns. MSF has been running an HIV/DR-TB clinic in Mumbai since 2006, focusing on patients with drug-resistant TB, HIV or both infections together."

For the past three weeks, several patients claimed to have been turned away from the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Most centres have run out of stocks of Tenofovir and Lamivudine, both of which are crucial drugs prescribed in combination with a few others as the first-line HIV regimen. Tenofovir, in certain instances, is also used as a combination drug in the second-line therapy.

        "body": "LONDON: American researchers claimed to have cured an infant of HIV infection in a medical breakthrough that raises hopes for thousands of babies across the world who contract the deadly virus in their mother\u2019s wombs. This is the first child \u2014 and only the second HIV-infected person \u2014 to have been cured of the disease, if the claim announced on Sunday by a research team from Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center (JHCC) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School is found to be true. The team hoped that the success could be replicated in other children born with HIV which would pave the way for eliminating the disease among children. HIV-related breakthroughs are rare and finding a vaccine has been a daunting challenge thanks to the ability of the virus to slip through. The researchers put a Mississippi-born infant, whose mother is HIV-positive, to antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth. The prompt administration led to the cure by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs \u2014 dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy. A series of tests showed progressively diminishing viral presence in the infant's blood, until it reached undetectable levels 29 days after birth. The infant remained on antivirals till 18 months of age. Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV. Test for HIV-specific antibodies \u2014 the infection\u2019s standard clinical indicator \u2014 also remained negative throughout. \u201cPrompt ART in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,\u201d said JHCC virologist Deborah Persaud. \u201cOur next step is to find out if this is a highly unusual response to very early antiretroviral therapy or something we can actually replicate in other high-risk newborns,\u201d Persaud added. Will it work for adults? The only other HIV-positive person to be cured was Timothy Brown, a middle-aged man with leukemia who got cured after receiving a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to HIV infection. In the current case, the New York Times cited experts saying they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected in the first place. \u201cIf not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers,\u201d it reported. Other experts were quoted as saying that the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults. The researchers said they did not have enough data at the moment to recommend changes to the current practice of using preventive rather than therapeutic treatment for high-risk infants. They said complete viral eradication on a large scale was their long-term goal. \u201cBut, for now, (it) remains out of reach, and our best chance may come from aggressive, timely and precisely targeted use of antiviral therapies in high-risk newborns as a way to achieve functional cure,\u201d the researchers said in their report. Functional cure allows a patient to be free of the HIV virus without lifelong treatment, besides preventing HIV replication in the blood. In this case, viral presence is so minimal that it remains undetectable by standard clinical tests. It is discernible only through ultrasensitive methods. \u201cPrevention really is the best cure, and we already have proven strategies that can prevent 98% of newborn infections by identifying and treating HIV-positive pregnant women,\u201d the report said. The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world. In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011. A latest UNAIDS Global HIV Epidemic Report revealed that 72% HIV-infected children in India and South East Asia do not have access to treatment. In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children."

The socio-economic review reveals that as compared to 2016-17, the number has gone up in 2017-18. Among the 2.90 lakh in the high-risk population covered till August 2017, 23,697 men reported having sex with males. Only 22,733 reported having sex with female sex workers. Among the 6.44 lakh in the high-risk population covered in 2016-17, 22,872 had had sex with men and 21,670 with female sex workers. Further, 917 injecting drug users (IDU) were documented in the 2016-17 survey in the high-risk population; the number increased to 1,025 till August 2017. Of the 6.44 lakh, 1.78 lakh were migrants and 4.19 lakh were truckers. The socio-economic review of the state\u2019s agriculture economy indicates a shift towards high-value crops such as cotton, groundnut, fruits and vegetables. According to the second advance estimates, production of foodgrain during 2017-18 is estimated to be 66.88 lakh tonnes compared to 74.20 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. The production of oilseeds is estimated to be over 49 lakh tonnes during 2017-18 against 46 lakh tonnes during 2016-17.

It is learnt that patent for the drug atazanavir bisulphate, filed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, was rejected because it 'lacked inventive ingenuity', while Abbott's patent application for lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) was turned down as it did not involve an 'inventive step'. The decision not only marks a major victory for public health and access to affordable treatment, but is particularly encouraging for government-run AIDS programme, which will soon provide second-in-line treatment to HIV patients. Already, the government-run programme covers approximately 3.8 lakh patients, mostly providing first-in-line AIDS drugs. After the recent Supreme Court directive, the government plans to scale it up and provide second-in-line treatment to a few thousands over the next couple of years. Both atazanavir (ATV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) are recommended by the World Health Organization for second-line AIDS therapy. LPV/r is also sometimes used as first-line therapy for infants born with HIV. Abbot is reviewing the ruling, and said: \"New formulation of Kaletra have provided physicians and patients with real improvements in its use, dosing and convenience\". However, the companies have filed other patent applications in relation to these two drugs which are still pending with the regulatory body. Public health experts said that the ruling will be a great relief for the growing number of people who have become resistant to their first combination of AIDS medicines and need 'second-line' therapy, and is an encouragement to other producers to come in and lower the price further. \"These decisions show how India's patent law, which prevents routine improvements from being patented, works in favour of public health by onlygranting patents for drugs that are truly innovative,\" said Leena Menghaney of MSF's Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines. \"Before 2006, there was no generic production of lopinavir/ritonavir, and Abbott was able to charge exorbitant prices\u2014close to US$6,000 per person per year in some developing countries,\" she added. Today, generic companies like Hetero and Ranbaxy have brought prices down substantially to $440 per patient per year. Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance director general D G Shah termed the development as important for access to affordable treatment, for millions suffering from the disease. Generic companies including Cipla and Hetero are major suppliers of AIDS drugs to developing countries like South Africa. The rejection means that there will be uninterrupted supply available from India to AIDS programmes in developing countries, some of which have even issued compulsory licenses (Ecuador,Thailand) to overcome their local patent barriers to procure the drug from here."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Using a specialised gene editing system, scientists have shown that they can eliminate HIV from the DNA of human cells, paving the way for a cure for AIDS patients. \"Antiretroviral drugs are very good at controlling HIV infection. But patients on antiretroviral therapy who stop taking the drugs suffer a rapid rebound in HIV replication,\" said Kamel Khalili, from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in US. The presence of numerous copies of HIV weakens the immune system and eventually causes AIDS. Eliminating the HIV virus after it has become integrated into CD4+ T-cells, the cells primarily infected with the virus, has proven difficult. Recent attempts have focused on intentionally reactivating HIV, aiming to stimulate a robust immune response capable of eradicating the virus. However, none of these \"shock and kill\" approaches has been successful. Researchers targeted HIV-1 proviral DNA (the integrated viral genome) using uniquely tailored gene editing technology. Their system includes a guide RNA that specifically locates HIV-1 DNA in the T-cell genome, and a nuclease enzyme, which cuts the strands of T-cell DNA. Once the nuclease has edited out the HIV-1 DNA sequence, the loose ends of the genome are reunited by the cel''s own DNA repair machinery.Researchers focused on infected CD4+ T cells to show that the technology eliminates the virus from cells and also its persistent presence in HIV-1-eradicated cells protects them against reinfection. The researchers carried their work over to ex vivo experiments, in which T-cells from patients infected with HIV were grown in cell culture, showing that treatment with the gene editing system can suppress viral replication and reduce viral load in patient cells.

In Pune district, AIDS counselling and testing facilities were virtually non-existent in as many as 43 of the 50 PHCs. In 2009, the state government was given a target of upgrading 721 PHCs under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) by March 2011. The PHCs were to be upgraded as per the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) to provide an optimal level of quality health care to the rural population. \"There is no denying that AIDS counselling and testing services are still defunct in many of the identified 24x7 PHCs in the state,\" Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), admitted to TOI on Monday. As many as 450 PHCs have been upgraded so far and the services of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) are available at 367 of these PHCs.\" The screening of persons showing high-risk behaviour as well as the one-test risk screening of pregnant mothers are expected to be carried out at the PHCs. On Friday, state health minister Suresh Shetty had convened a high-level meeting in Nagpur where he issued fresh instructions to the district health officers, the district programme officer and the civil surgeon to take active steps to revive ICTC services in non-performing PHCs. When contacted, Shetty said, \"There are various issues responsible for the poor functioning of the ICTC services at the PHCs. A shortage of trained manpower is one of them. We are planning to rope in a skilled workforce like technicians and counsellors, either permanently or on contract, to streamline the functioning. Meetings are on. We are sorting out issues.\" Shetty pointed out that the ICTC services at the 24x7 PHCs in Tamil Nadu are a success thanks to the adequate workforce there. Deshmukh claimed that the regular transfer of trained staff required to carry out crucial jobs like testing and counselling at the PHCs was among the main reasons for work being hampered. \"There is also no sense of accountability among the staff who run the ICTC services at these PHCs. A shortage of testing kits also impedes work,\" he said. Deshmukh said that of the 50 PHCs in Pune district which are supposed to offer ICTC services, only seven were functioning well. Similar was the situation in districts like Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola, he said."

The civic body is organizing a programme titled \u2018Hanuman Chalisa\u2019 on April 7 for creating awareness regarding deadly diseases among the citizens. A division bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and justice Swapna Joshi issued notices to NMC commissioner and other four respondents asking him to reply by Saturday, when the next hearing is fixed. Petitioner \u2014 Nagari Hakka Saurakhshan Manch through its president Janardhan Moon \u2014 has filed a PIL (No. 2054/2016) contending that leader of ruling party in NMC has organized the event where \u2018Hanuman Chalisa\u2019 would be chanted and due to that citizens from other religions will not be able to participate. His counsel Ashwin Ingole said sentiments of those from other religions would be hurt as menace of AIDS was not restricted to any single community, but spread globally. Ingole argued that people from all religions are entitled to participate in the programme as per Constitutional right offered to them under Article 25. Hence chanting of \u2018Hanuman Chalisa\u2019 would severely affect their rights. Moreover, the organizers are also spending precious taxpayers money of Rs50 lakh on it, instead of utilizing it for a good cause. The petitioner cited respondents\u2019 Facebook post where they had appealed to the citizens to participate in large numbers with a view to make a world record of chanting \u2018Hanuman Chalisa\u2019 by over 1.5 lakh people. The NGO demanded to either stay the event or drop chanting of the \u2018Chalisa\u2019 from the April 7 programme so that people from all religions could participate. The NMC standing committee will meet on April 2 to discuss a number of issues related to the event at Kasturchand Park. The panel has to clear the tender to appoint an event manager. The BJP-ruled body is already flak from all quarters for spending on this event."

        "title": "Bihar's HIV narrative in the light of red candles",
        "body": "PATNA: On Sunday on May 19, 2001, 150 and odd citizens, among whom were Doctors AA Hai , Sita Mukhopadhyay , Sandeep Sen and Dilip Sen, representatives from Kurji Holy Family Hospital, the then head of Unicef Jean Gough , well known educationists Shanker Dutt , Muniba Sami and the cream of the social service sector such as Augustine Veliath , Vandana Nair , Sanat Sinha and Parveen Amanullah , walked from the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir to the JP statue near Gandhi Maidan bearing red candles. It was the city's first ever edition of the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial (IACM ). This Sunday evening on May 19, 2013, people from all walks of life will participate in the memorial service, which falls on the third Sunday of May. It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. The lighting of the candle is an important part of the ritual. \"What's the use of lighting a candle?\" scoffed a sit- at- the- computer smart-aleck-Facebook troll. On that hot summer night of 2001, the 'official' HIV figures in Bihar stood at 35 infected and 1 death. That night, in the glow of the red candles, it was revealed that some 900 people had tested positive during the past five years, and this was with data from just Sens' Lab and Kurji Holy Family Hospital. This news appeared widely in the local press. It, of course, embarrassed the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) people who had also come to the 'show', carrying a large BSACS banner. Those red candles flickering in the summer breeze challenged the opaque darkness of ignorance and apathy. A stunned BSACS spokesperson could only say, \"These are not government figures. We don't include data from private hospitals.\" The lameness of the retort was self-evident. As a direct consequence, under the leadership of CK Anil, BSACS began improving services and surveillance. When the next IACM was held a year later, BSACS reporting had greatly improved, voluntary counselling and testing centres were being set up, and 1097 HIV/AIDS helplines had been set up. In 2002, the candles brought to light the issues of silence and stigma. They brought to the fore two things: one, that HIV infections were closer to middle class Bihar than reported, and two, that the obsolete Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was obstructing the battle against HIV and AIDS. Giving the keynote address was a young Bihar-born activist lawyer named Aditya Bandhopadhyay, who was defending the workers of the Naz Foundation International (NFI) in Lucknow, who had been arrested for 'abetting unnatural offences' by distributing condoms and running a sexual health and AIDS prevention centre for non-heterosexual males. 'Integration', one of Kolkata's pioneering Queer Rights groups, performed at the Memorial. It was this year that a symbolic 'Reading of the Names' was started: speaking the names of people lost to HIV and AIDS. The list had some 25 names, people lost to AIDS who were close to the participants and organizers. In 2003, the Memorial had its first transgender guest of honour, Lallan Hijra, who introduced into the Bihar HIV AIDS narrative the voices of the marginalized. She spoke of the trauma of accessing medical services of any kind; how 'hijras' were generally treated like dirt by doctors and nurses alike. She said if Bihar opened its eyes to the fact that transgenders would always be there, and let them access education and skills in peace, they wouldn't be a community forced to dance and beg and be vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. Arriving that day to light the Memorial candle were Arif Jafar and Shivananda Khan. Arif Jafar was the person arrested in the NFI Lucknow case, and he spoke of how media insensitivity and sensationalism coupled with misuse of Section 377 by the police would only cripple society further. The candles also shone on another dark corner, the fate of street children. And so on, year after year, aware and concerned citizens come to light candles in the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. We have lit them when Bihar continued to be in denial, hiding under the cloak of being a 'low incidence state', ignoring the stark reality of high migration of labour and the non-availability of testing at district level. We lighted them as realization dawned that Bihar was a 'vulnerable state'. Over the years we have lit candles with sadness as the people lost to AIDS have become familiar, and we have lit them with hope as people with HIV have gained the courage to come out of the darkness of anonymity and speak for themselves. Tonight the candles glow to remind us that HIV is no longer a ticket to death, if only the required ART treatment is made accessible and affordable. They glow to announce that since 2012, we can claim that some 95 children out of every 100 are born HIV free to infected mothers, thanks to the ART regimen for pregnant HIV positive women. They will glow to dispel the myth that HIV is spread through a razor blade. They also light up the fact that there are more than 55,000 HIV positive children, women and men recorded so far in Bihar, and most still face discrimination and stigma. That is why every candle that flickers in the wind is so very important."

        "body": "KOLKATA: It is invisible to the naked eye and originated in the uninhabitable climes of Antarctica. This humble bacteria \u2014 known as Psychrophile \u2014 holds the potential to solve India\u2019s sanitation problem in the years to come. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is using these bacteria for the bio-digester technology it developed for disposal of human waste in an eco-friendly manner. DRDO has already tied up with the Indian Railways for bio-toilets on trains. On Sunday, the technology will be inaugurated on Sunday at Dhamra in Odisha in the presence of Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of rural development, drinking water and sanitation.?It was Ramesh\u2019s caustic remark in May that got the DRDO involved in installing the odourless bio-toilets that it had developed in rural areas. The minister had rued the fact that while India is capable of launching inter continental ballistic missiles like Agni and satellites, women still don\u2019t have access to proper sanitation. According to him, 60% of women in the country do not have access to toilets. Immediately after this, DRDO took it upon itself to take up rural sanitation as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility. The location chosen was Dhamra, which is close to the spot from where the Agni-V missile was successfully test-fired recently. The toilets developed by DRDO were originally meant for harsh climates. They can function at temperatures ranging from -55 degree Celsius to 60 degree Celsius. DRDO scientists brought the bacteria from Antarctica and started to develop them to suit Indian standards. This bacteria breaks down human waste and produces colourless and odourless inflammable bio gas that comprises 50-70% methane. \"There is a bio-digester underneath where the temperature is maintained at 5-30 degree Celsius. The bacteria break down the waste. There is no foul smell, disease-carrying organisms or solid matter. Nearly 90% of the solid waste is reduced. The bio-gas is released into the air continuously and can be used for cooking and heating. The residual liquid can be drained without any ill-effect,\" a scientist said. The Army has already set up these toilets in Siachen and other high-altitude regions and also in bases in the desert . The plan is to cover at least 1,000 Gram Panchayats across the country with this technology soon. The toilets are extremely easy to set up and scientists assure that the bacteria will be soon available in packets and pouches. By the end of this year, at least some of some trains in the country will have the bio-degradable toilets on a pilot basis."

        "body": "HYDERABAD: Questions on how the 18-month-old girl from Guntur got HIV virus still remain unanswered. While the tests carried out by a Chennai-based lab have confirmed that the baby has the deadly virus, they have ruled out that the source of the disease is either her parents or a donor. Doctors in both the states now say that only a paternity test will reveal if the father of the baby is her biological parent. \"We got an oral report from the Chennai-based lab that the DNA PCR test revealed that the girl is HIV positive, while both parents are negative. We are yet to receive the report copy,\" said the doctor at the hospital. \"Maybe the parents are wrongly claiming that she is their child. A paternity test will perhaps reveal the truth,\" said a doctor at the Guntur Medical College, who cannot be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Her father and a donor had once donated blood to her. But district health authorities informed that the donor was traced and he tested negative for HIV. Now, the flummoxed medical team suspects the donor could have been in the window period (time between the onset of HIV infection and the appearance of detectable antibodies of the virus) when the blood was transfused to the child. Any antibody-based blood tests, such as ELISA and rapid test, conducted during the window period may give negative results. During this window period the individual is already infected and may unknowingly infect other people. Doctors say a thorough probe can also reveal if the child was adopted or a healthy baby was swapped after birth. \"There are endless possibilities, but the case has become so complicated,\" a hospital source said. Doctors at the Guntur hospital are now preparing the girl for Anti Retroviral Therapy to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progression. But taking her condition into consideration, it is unlikely that the therapy will start immediately, they said. The baby was given blood transfusion on March 8 after she was found to be suffering from anaemia. As her condition did not improve doctors conducted tests and found that she was HIV positive. The girl was tested HIV positive at a private hospital at Kothapet about four days after she was admitted with pneumonia. As they were not sure, they wanted to carry out fresh tests."

Whatsapp messages of Namratha P, 7, and her brother Namith P, 5, children of Prashanth, a tender coconut seller, and Shailaja, a domestic help, going missing had gone viral, and helped police rescue them. Acting on a complaint from the parents, police scoured footage from CCTV cameras in Geddalahalli. Some cameras had captured images of the children walking with Vinod, 25, a ragpicker from the locality, and police registered a case of kidnap and escalated investigations. Police said after school, the children would come to their grandfather, who also sold tender coconuts in Geddalahalli, and hang around. The children knew Vinod, who often visited their grandfather and brought them sweets. On the day of the kidnap, he lured the kids with the promise of sweets, and took them to Tirupati. Sanjayanagar police said they requested their father Prashanth to send photographs of the children to all his friends and relatives. Prashanth took his friend Avinash's help to send the missing children's picture to as many people as they could. One of the recipients of Avinash's message was a friend, Venkatesh, who lives in Tirupati. Coincidentally, Vinod who had headed to Tirupati with the children, met Venkatesh and asked him for a job. He introduced the children as his own. Venkatesh realized who the children were after he saw the WhatsApp message from Avinash. Venkatesh alerted Avinash. Soon, a team of Sanjayanagar police rushed to Tirupati and rescued the children from Vinod. Police said Vinod managed to escape before they reached the spot, leaving the children behind, and that they have no clue why he had kidnapped the children. Police claimed the children had not been harassed by the abductor, except being forced to call him their dad. Shailaja, their mother, said, \"We don't know Vinod. We learnt that he frequently visited a scrap shop near the place where my father-in-law sells tender coconuts, and the kids knew him as he gave them sweets. Vinod must be punished as he threatened my children at knife-point.\" \"Efforts are on to nab Vinod and we will come to know the purpose of the kidnap once we nab him. There was one case of theft against him in Yeshwantpur police station in 2013, and he was arrested then,\" a police officer said."

        "title": "1,200 beneficiaries to receive hearing aids free of cost",
        "body": "Tirunelveli: Distribution of custom made hearing aids at free of cost to 1,200 beneficiaries, including 1,100 children, from five districts began in Tirunelveli on Wednesday. The student beneficiaries were aged between four and 16 from seven schools in Kanyakumari, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Virudhunagar districts. While 600 persons received hearing aids on Wednesday, the rest will receive on Thursday. Representatives of USA based Starkey Hearing Foundation who distributed the hearing aids to the beneficiaries, at the two-day event, said that the total price of the hearing aids (1,500 pairs) was Rs 2.5 crore. \u201cEach pair cost from Rs 22,000 to Rs 27,000 based on the condition of the beneficiary,\u201d senior clinical audiologist with Starkey India B Rajan told TOI. Though the foundation has been distributing hearing aids free of cost in India from 2007, this is the first time they have come to Tamil Nadu. \u201cSo far we have distributed more than 2 lakh hearing aids to over 1 lakh persons. This includes the Guinness Book of World Records event at Gujarat where-in hearing aids were fitted to 16,000 beneficiaries in two days. The process of identifying beneficiaries here began in April,\u201d he said. Following a preliminary survey in schools for special children, the representatives of the foundation identified those from financially backward families and then tested their degree of impairment. Custom made moulds were then made to find the size needed for individual beneficiaries, following which the hearing aids were custom made. On Wednesday, in the event facilitated by the Tirunelveli east district unit of the BJP, a team of 50 personnel from Starkey Hearing Foundation including 24 doctors from the USA began fitting hearing aids for the beneficiaries. The aids were tested and the volume was adjusted, followed by a two time quality check. Anxious beneficiaries were then given counselling on the dos and don\u2019ts and were also given a set of batteries for their devices for a period of two years (four batteries a month). Founder of Starkey Hearing Foundation William F Austin and representatives of BJP took part in the event. BJP cadres facilitated transportation, lodging and other basic arrangements for the beneficiaries."

        "title": "Wives at HIV risk from bisexual husbands",
        "body": "When Savitha\u2019s* husband returned at four in the morning, the scent of a woman on him roused her suspicion. The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser. Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice \u2014 narrating her husband\u2019s affairs with other men \u2014 is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married men who have sex with men (MSM) and their wives. According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting HIV compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government. Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 women were aware of their husbands\u2019 sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use. \"The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,\" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. \"The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country\u2019s HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,\" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Durham University. The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands\u2019 same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners. Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. \"If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,\" he said. The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners. Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. \"Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don\u2019t listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,\" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai. Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands\u2019 sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children. Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. \"Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was \"necessary\", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. \u2018I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?\u2019 asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,\" said Solomon. \"But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,\" he added. The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands\u2019 same-sex behaviour. \"For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men\u2019s own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives.\" Researchers also suggested forming more support groups for these women.

The state administration had to hand over the body of John D'Souza, accused of sexually abusing minor boys, after his family met state chief secretary Sanjay Srivastava, who issued orders to this effect last night. John's family members claimed that his body was not being handed over to them as post-mortem was to be conducted on it since John, who died on January 15 while being treated at Goa Medical college and hospital, was a HIV patient. Prison authorities refused to hand over John's body to the relatives despite repetitive pleadings, they alleged. The kin, along with NGO Positive People, approached the state chief secretary and briefed him about the alleged harassment. They claimed that they had been asked to hop from one office to another under the pretext of formalities and clearances and were being harassed as John was an AIDS patient. Positive People, working for the people living with HIV, termed the attitude of state administration as 'shocking'. \"It is indeed shocking that the district authorities have not been able to release the body and have caused unnecessary pain and harassment to the grieving family who just wants to give a decent and dignified funeral to their dear one,\" the NGO's letter to the chief secretary said. D'Souza was kept in Sada sub-jail since his arrest in November 2009 for allegedly sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy in his car. The family members were asked to sign an affidavit stating that they have no suspicion on John's death before being handed over the body."

        "body": "ANANTAPUR: In what could be a clear case of social boycott, a four-year-old girl was sent out of a private school by parents of other students suspecting her to be HIV-positive. This shocking incident happened at Rao's English medium private school in Vidyuthnagar area in Anantapur on Tuesday. Angry parents forced the school management to send her out after photographs of her HIV-positive mother and stepfather were splashed in local media a few days ago. Though no medical tests had confirmed that the girl was HIV-positive, the irate parents, who have been staging protests outside the school, forcibly took the girl to a private clinic where the staff refused to conduct medical tests on her. Later, they took her to the government hospital. They insisted that the girl be sent out immediately. It all started when the girl's mother M Lakshmi Devi married another HIV-positive patient K Khader Vali on Aug 20 at the Congress office here in the presence of agriculture minister N Raghuveera Reddy and MP A Venkatrami Reddy on the occasion of Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary. The girl was the daughter of Devi and M Kiran Kumar of Pulivendula in Kadapa district. Kiran migrated to Anantapur and worked as a room boy in a lodge. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive three years ago and died in March this year. Devi took shelter at a private NGO since then and the NGO head Usharani, who herself is HIV-positive, convinced Devi to enter into a wedlock with Vali. But with the HIV-positive couple's marriage receiving wide coverage in the local media, the parents swooped on the school and forcibly sent out the poor girl. While Usharani urged the district officials to take stringent action against the erring parents, district educational officer D Premanadam and II Town inspector A Srinivasulu went to the school to convince the parents. When contacted, school correspondent Madhav Rao said they have no objection to the girl studying since she has not tested positive for HIV. \"Why should the poor girl be harassed for no fault of hers,\" Usharani questioned."

        "body": "BENGALURU: A sex worker should be able to get a condom in 12-30 minutes, states one of the objectives of National Aids Control Programme. However, this isn't the case in Karnataka, especially in Ramanagaram, Udupi and Hassan districts and Doddaballapur taluk, thanks to glitches in condom supply and distribution programmes of the Karnataka State AIDS Pre vention Society (KSAPS). Result: The threat of a spurt in HIV infections looms large over the state. Every month, the government supplies 26-30 lakh condoms for free to sex workers and sexual minorities in Karnataka. But the stock available for December is a mere 6.9 lakh. However, KASPS project director SG Raveendra denied the shortage. \u201cWe should be receiving more stocks soon; there's no problem,\u201c he told TOI. However, peer educators supplying condoms to high-risk groups and NGOs involved in the HIV-prevention programme confirmed there was indeed a severe scarcity of condoms. Karnataka is considered one of the states with the highest number of HIV-positive persons. The state has over 87,000 sex workers who should ideally be covered under the free condom programme. According to NGOs and activists, the shortage will affect distribution of condoms to all high-risk groups and sites, including migrants, truckers, transshipment points and highways. \u201cWe are fighting AIDS with our back to the wall. Any glitch in the process will only affect lives and escalate the financial coordinates of treatment cost,\u201c they say . \u201cMany targeted interventions (free condom distribution) for female sex workers have been closed in districts like Ramanagaram, Bangalore Rural and Udupi. Thousands of sex workers are struggling to get stocks of free condoms.Sex workers who led the prevention programme as peer educators are now idle with no supplies. The good work of the last 10 years will be wasted and deaths due to AIDSrelated illness could increase,\u201c explained Bharathi, a sex worker and general secretary of Karnataka sex workers union. The union works in 22 districts of the state and has a paid membership of over 3,000 sex workers who are activists too. Distribution issue: A KSAPS official admitted that there were problems in Ramanagaram and Udupi districts. \u201cIf high-risk groups are not getting condoms, then the problem could be at the distribution level. We will have a discussion with the NGOs to address the issue,\u201c said the officer. Another concern is that most of NGOs working with KSAPS have severed their links with the society over various issues. The agency needs to recruit new NGOs to implement the targeted intervention programme of distributing condoms."

        "title": "HIV study reveals double jeopardy",
        "body": "MUMBAI: The clever HIV virus could be present in drastically different variants in the bodily fluids\u2014blood and semen\u2014of the same individual. This was recently established by a study of 12 HIV-infected men whose blood and semen samples were analyzed by Parel's National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH). The finding is significant, said scientists of NIRRH, as it negates the notion that an infected person can go slow on treatment or think of starting a family once the viral load in the bloodstream becomes undetectable . The study clearly established that the type and behaviour of the HIV virus present in the bloodstream of an infected individual could be drastically different from the type and behaviour of the virus present in the same individual's semen. In certain cases, it could look as if the individual is infected with two different types of virus altogether. The pathbreaking HIV study, carried out by NIRRH in collaboration with the JJ Hospital's medicine department, was recently published in the Journal of Medical Virology. Principal investigator Dr A H Bandivadekar told TOI that the study proves that the virus could disappear from the blood stream due to anti-retroviral therapy but still be very much present in the semen . \"This difference in the virus nature influences the transmission of HIV, the progression of the ailment , the virus' response to the host defence and also treatment,\" he added. Further, Bandivadekar added that the study pointed out that sperm-associated virus too is a huge risk factor for HIV transmission and possibly for parent child transmission. \"Therefore, assisted reproductive technology where sperm washing is used may not be termed as a completely safe procedure for maternal or fetal transmission of HIV,\" he said. The study further adds to the intriguing nature of the virus as it adds to the unpredictability, given its nature of constant mutation. In several of the individuals studied, the viral count in the blood differed vastly from the count in semen. For instance, while the blood plasma in one individual had 11,284 copies of the virus, the viral presence in his semen was around 5,432 copies. Also ,in two individuals, the virus load in the blood had gone below detectable levels, but there were significant quantities of the virus present in the semen. Simply put, the virus in the blood and semen infect the same individual in different ways. Head of JJ Hospital's ART centre and one of the investigators, Dr Alka Deshpande, said the study also means that those on anti-retroviral medication should not think that it could keep the virus in both the compartments, blood and semen, under control. \"It is now clear that there could be genetic differences in virus even if they are present in the same individual's body,\" she added. \"It only means that whenever a vaccine or drug is created, the variant nature of the virus has to be kept in mind so that it can attack all compartments,\" she added."

WHO officials threw light on Rajasthan\u2019s status relating to HIV/AIDS at a press briefing on the second day of WHO\u2019s South East Asia Region\u2019s 64th session of the Regional Committee meeting here on Thursday. Rajasthan\u2019s Sriganganagar is in category A, while Alwar, Ajmer, Tonk, Udaipur and Barmer are in the category B in terms of risks and prevalence. Category A districts are those which have more than 1% pregnant women suffering HIV/AIDS. Category B stands for districts which have less than 1% prevalence and with more than 5% prevalence in any high risk groups (such as truckers and mine workers). The high risk groups include female sex workers, homosexuals and injection drug users. These districts require priority attention. WHO\u2019s regional advisor Dr Iyanthi Abeywicrame said, \u201cThere are many factors which makes Rajasthan a high risk state. The reasons include, people from Rajasthan migrate to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Gujarat and return with the disease. Another reason is that there are 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh workers, most of them migrants. Also, every day 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The truckers have high prevalence of HIV.\u201d She said the state is also important on the map of tourism. \u201cA lot of tourists come to Rajasthan from foreign or from other parts of the country. Also, given the large population of Rajasthan, 68 million, even a small increase in HIV would translate into a large number of cases. Illiteracy is another reason of high risk.\u201d"

While unprotected sexual contact has for long been the main cause of the HIVAIDS epidemic, what is surprising this time around is that the all-India average is lower. \u201cCompared to Mumbai's 91%, the all-India figure is 80%,\u201c added Dr Acharya. The Mumbai AIDS control figures for 2015-16 show that among the remaining cases, 5.7% got infected from infected mother to child, 0.2% people were infected due to unsafe blood and 0.5% through infected needles or syringes. The government has taken several steps to break the HIV transmission chain. \u201cThere is such awareness about unsafe needles that this transmission chain is almost negligible,\u201c said Eldred Tellis from NGO Sankalp. He said that while there were 15,000 drug-injectors in Mumbai in 2,000, the number fell to 8,000 in 2008 and stood around 1,000 this year. The new three-drug regimen started two years back to prevent mother-to-child transmission too has yielded results."

        "body": "PONDA: With a large number of migrants pouring into Goa, the HIV epidemic is turning into a frightening reality as the state has registered about 30 percent cases of HIV infection among non-Goans including people from other states and foreigners. A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased. From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013. Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown AIDS cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS). According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year. In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013. But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state. People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted. \u201cBesides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,\u201d Patankar said. She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. There are 3,476 people including 1,962 males, 1,327 females, 183 children below the age of 14 years and four transgenders have registered for the ART, statistics point out."

        "body": "AURANGABAd: An awareness camp on importance of nutrition for burn patients held here on Sunday emphasised on the role of proteins in the diet for speedy recovery. Experts at the event said that aggressive nutrition support is essential to ensure quick healing for burn care victims, attenuate the hyper-metabolic response, optimize wound healing, minimize devastating catabolism, and reduce morbidity and mortality. \"Burn injury continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional support has become an essential element of burn care. Failure to meet the increased substrate requirements may result in impaired wound healing, multi-organ dysfunction, increased susceptibility to infection, and death,\" said Ramakant Bemde, plastic surgeon and burn specialist.While speaking on 'burn patient nutrition', Pune-based dietician Archana Roy said that high protein and caloric diet is essential for speedy recovery of burn patients. Burn patients should increase their protein content in their normal diet by threefold and should continue for at least six months till they recover completely.Another dietician Renuka Raje in a similar camp held at a city-based burns and hand surgery multi-speciality hospital on Saturday said, \"The increased metabolic response associated with a severe burn surpasses that of any other disease state. A burn patient needs a high-calorie, high-protein diet to promote wound healing, minimize the risk of complications and maintain a normal nutritional level.\"\"After a burn, the body breaks down muscles to use as energy for the healing process. Protein is also lost through the burn wounds. If a burn patient does not consume enough protein to compensate, it can lead to decreased wound healing, loss of muscle mass and low immune function,\" said Pranjali Jadhav, another dietician .\"The provision of the right balance of macro and micronutrients along with additional antioxidants is essential to mitigate the hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic state that results following a burn injury,\" said Bemde."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Government may face some tough questions during the monsoon session of Parliament with its ambitious national AIDS control program in jeopardy due to the lack of funds. At least 15 states have reported severe shortage of free condoms, while five to six of them have announced they are out of stock, sources said. READ ALSO: Condom shortage \u2014 Jitters in Nashik ahead of Kumbh HIV fears rise over condom shortage in states Though shortages have been continuing for over a year now, many states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh have now said they have completely exhausted their stocks of condoms. Some are even short of viral load testing kits and antiretroviral medicines. Condoms are distributed free mainly among vulnerable population of female sex workers, long distance truckers, transgenders, drug users etc. Faced with a significant cut in NACO\u2019s budget, absence of global funding and part of the budget diverted to states, the Centre seems reluctant to spend more on condoms, sources say. On the other hand, in the absence of supplies or any clear directive from the Centre, many states have announced stock outs while some have reached out to global health agencies seeking intervention. \u201cThere are a number of problems. Funding, among them, is the major one but it is linked with problems in procurement, supply chain, delayed payment to companies manufacturing condoms, drugs and testing kits,\u201d says Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary, National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India, a group that works closely with HIV infected people. Maharashtra, one of the high risk states with an HIV prevalence of over 0.40%, generates an annual demand of 3.90 crore condoms under the AIDS prevention programme. While the state has been reeling under erratic supplies since December last year, several NGOs in the state have started reporting condom stock-outs over the last couple of weeks putting over 8 lakh vulnerable people, such as female sex workers, transgender, men having sex with men at risk. The situation is similar in many other states including Haryana, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Punjab. Most of these states were facing irregular supplies for over a year and which has almost come to a standstill now. Punjab State Aids Control Society additional project director Manpreet Chhatwal agrees there is a fund crunch impacting supplies. \u201cWe are working towards devising how we can generate funds without depending solely on the Centre,\u201d said Chhatwal. While states blame it on the Centre for lack of supplies, some like Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab tried resolving the problem by borrowing from global organizations and other sources. However, given the huge demand, supplies could be met for just a few months. The crisis has straightaway put a population of 32 lakh at risk, who were covered under the National AIDS Control programme through targeted intervention groups, as per the estimates made by health ministry for 2011. However, public health experts say these numbers are very conservative and the real numbers are much higher. This has raised concerns among public health activists and health workers fighting the spread of deadly diseases. Parliamentarians are now likely to bring up the issue in Parliament demanding clarity from the government, sources said. Target intervention groups, which distribute condoms as part of public health programmes, have written to the State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (SACS) and other bodies, urgently seeking supplies, sources said. These shortages assume significance because India continues to battle against the infection. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world."

        "body": "AHMEDABAD: An expert committee has opined that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test to detect HIV infection should not be made mandatory for all licensed blood banks due to lack of infrastructure and expertise in the country, but conceded that the test can be conducted at select centres. The union ministry for health and the family welfare department along with the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) formed an expert committee to look into the issue. This was on the basis of a Gujarat High Court order passed on November 8 last year in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding that the PCR test or the Nucleic Acid Amblification Test (NAAT) should be made mandatory in lieu of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for detection of HIV infection. The PIL argued that the PCR test reduces the 'window period,' that is, the time period the body takes to produce antibodies in response to HIV infection, also the time period during which the HIV virus is undetectable. The committee was asked to recommend the extent to which PCR test should be made mandatory at all licensed blood banks. It submitted its report on Thursday with conclusions and recommendations. The committee has concluded that the NAAT can at best be an add-on test of HIV screening along with routine mandated antibody screening tests by immunoassay. NAAT is technically demanding and our blood banks are not adequately equipped to carry it out for routine purposes. It also said that NAAT assays may not provide zero risk for acquiring transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) as it does not completely eliminate the window period. After listing out eight reasons why PCR cannot be made mandatory in India, the experts recommended that it should not be made compulsory for all blood banks, since the high turnaround time in screening donated blood may lead to a delay in utilization and may compromise accessibility of blood and blood components. Moreover, its introduction would necessitate amendment in the regulatory framework. The expert group further opined that since there is insufficient data on the additional yield of TTI viral markers as well as operational and technical feasibility in India, selected centres may be identified to conduct this test. A further hearing on this issue will be held next Thursday."

        "body": "NAGPUR : Considering the relatively high incidence of HIV in Kamptee and surrounding areas, the state health department is starting an antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre in Kamptee . The centre would be formally launched by Dr Manohar Pawar , deputy director of health services, on Friday at 11am . Speaking to reporters about the centre, district civil surgeon Dr V D Bade said that the satellite town of Kamptee attracted a lot of a migrant population due to various companies, collieries, and transport businesses and this brought in commercial sex workers as well. Hence, the health department provided for the ART centre for better treatment of HIV-positive patients of the area. With this centre, they would not need to come to city to procure drugs that are to be taken by the affected persons all their life. Though there has been a substantial fall in the HIV-positive mothers as well as the high risk population in Nagpur district in the past 4-5 years, there has been a rise in cases in Kamptee area both in general population as well as of mothers. Tanuja Fale, district programme officer HIV/AIDS project, said the incidence of HIV positivity inn mothers had fallen from 0.32% (171 positive) to 0.17% (88 positive) from 2011 to February 2013. This figure in high risk population has, however, seen only a marginal fall from 3.20% (2300 positive persons) to 3.07% (1768 persons) during the same period. The HIV positivity rate in the town was as high as 7% in general population and 0.63% in mothers in 2008 but the rate dropped substantially over the years. Yet there is still a cause of concern for the relatively high number of patients in both the groups and hence the need for a separate ART Centre in Kamptee which draws people for work from even areas like Pardi Naka, Tarsa and Mouda. This year alone, the health department has found 61 more new cases. The state health department, with financial help from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), is starting the centre to cater to the local population. NACO would be providing funds for the salaries of all the seven staff members including the medical officers, technical and lab staff, counsellors and project coordinators. Health department is working in coordination with other agencies like Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Government Medical College and Hospital, Daga Memorial Hospital as well selected private hospitals in the city to filter out patients of the area and provide them drugs at Kamptee itself as the high risk population needed to be monitored regularly to check the spread of the disease. Dr Umesh Nawade, medical superintendent of Kamptee, was also present."

According to the students, teachers questioned them in the school, asking them whether they were HIV positive, if they take their medicines regularly and what food they eat at the hostel. The teachers asked them to leave the school and return with their parents. Headmistress of the school P G Udikeri told TOI, \"We don't allow HIV positive children in the school as the parents of other students oppose it.\" She also said there was a separate school for these children in Sadashiv Nagar. Recently, parents stopped sending their children to a government school in Sadashiv Nagar when they found that HIV positive children were studying there. Mahesh Jadhav, head of an NGO, said all seven children who were sent away from the school were not HIV positive and he had informed the headmistress of this. \"Despite this, the teachers have humiliated the children in the school, which is unfortunate,\" he said. DDPI V M Patil visited the school in the afternoon and hauled up the teachers for the incident. He warned them of stringent action if such a thing happened in the future. V B Kulkarni, district AIDS prevention control officer, said what happened in Kanabargi School was unfortunate and showed that there is a need to create awareness among teachers about HIV and AIDS. \"We will carry the (awareness) campaign shortly,\" he said."

        "body": "PUNE: Arranging 500 marriages in seven years may not sound like a great achievement for a matrimonial website. But for PositiveSaathi.com it is no mean feat. Seven years ago, when city-based Regional Transport Office inspector Anil Valiv launched this matrimonial website dedicated to matchmaking of HIV-positive people, he never thought his initiative would get such a huge response. \"We do not have the resources to follow up on our registered users, but we conservatively estimate that at least 500 marriages have been fixed among our users. The number can even be double of that,\" Valiv said. Valiv was posted in Latur in 2006 when he heard about an HIV positive man looking for a bride and thought of starting a website that connects HIV positive people. Operating out of a small office in Mangalwar Peth, PositiveSaathi.com has emerged as a relative success story. It registers bride and groom-seekers for free, regularly organises matrimonial meets and has quite a few success stories to its credit. One such matrimonial meet was held in Mumbai on Saturday in association with the State AIDS Control Society. \"We have had to convince potential users that we verify the users' background regularly, and that their identities shall be secured to all possible extents,\" Valiv said. Among the first marriages the website forged was that of an HIV-positive boy from Hyderabad, who was working in Singapore, with a London-based Indian girl who had divorced her husband after she found she had contracted the infection from him. She also had a daughter. Both had registered themselves on the website and after meeting and talking to each other, they decided to tie the knot. Administrators of the website say that the matrimonial process is fairly arduous and one that requires them to stay alert. There are many fake profiles and profiles of married people too, which is why they have to frequently revisit their databases and carry out background checks of users. \"Another problem is the male-to-female registration ratio on our website as well as in our matrimonial meets is heavily skewed. For every 10 male registrations, only about two to three women register. Also, after the potential bride and groom meet through the website or via the meetings, aspects like financial condition, caste, creed, and religion do come up,\" he said. The success stories more than make up for the hassles. \"In 2012, we had organised a similar matrimonial meet for HIV-positive persons in Pune, and to our surprise, five couples who met that day went to a registrar and got married,\" one of the website administrators said. Then there was the case of a 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Pune who was encouraged by her uncles to get married again after her divorce. She came to know about our website from her doctor. Her profile was soon uploaded on the website where she connected with a man from Mumbai. They got married two years ago. The website's administrators say the website can possibly achieve much more if there is state support. \"We do not really receive much support from the state government. In fact, we collaborated with the state AIDS control society for the first time during our Mumbai meet. To get people to register on our website, we try to engage various non-governmental organisations, who have been working in the field of HIV-AIDS prevention. Their participation is very crucial for our venture to work,\" said Valiv."

Assisted by the Changsha Food and Drugs Supervision Bureau, the police arrested the owner of the company. This is alarming because medical experts and non-government organizations working in the field of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases repeatedly warn that fake and poor quality condoms play a key role in their spread. Such disease has been rising sharply because of the increase in migrant labor numbering about 300 million, most of whom live away from families. Experts also say that extramarital and premier-marital sex is the biggest contributing factor while causes like blood transfusion has low impact. The size of the seizure may be much larger because the police are investigating two other condom making units run by the same businessman, surnamed Chen. Working together, 200 policemen busted the five story house and seized 28 million semi-manufactured condoms and six million manufactured condoms. The seized products, packing materials and machines all together were valued at $35 million. The arrested factory owner was working on a false registration, which showed the company was involved in the production, assemblage and sales of electronic toys. The company used vibrators, inflatable dolls and other types of sex toys as a cover for its unlawful business because it had no license for condom manufacturing. Condom making is a highly controlled industry because low quality material can result in unwanted pregnancies and sexual disease including AIDS. But sex toy industry is a widely prevalent in China, which is the world's exporter of it. The illegally made condoms was made under established brand names including foreign ones to enhance their sales appeal. These condoms were sold to all regions in China except for Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, according to China.com. China made condoms including fake ones have become popular in neighboring countries as well. A report from Kathmandu said the local police raided and recovered China made condoms and sex toys worth $50,000 from a shop, which was selling under false license."

I want to live a life with dignity and want someone who is intelligent, sober, and caring,\" Junali told IANS. The website (www.hitchiv.com) to be launched later this month at the behest of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+) has already generated a lot of interest among HIV- positive people. \"We have already got about 150 to 200 requests for membership despite the fact that the website is yet to be launched,\" Jahnabi Goswami, president of INP+, said. Goswami, 32, is one of the few women in India fighting to raise awareness about the disease. She belongs to an even smaller group of people who have publicly declared that they are HIV- positive. Membership to the website would be open only to people living with HIV/AIDS. \"Strict privacy would be maintained and only registered members will be able to log in and scan profiles of prospective partners,\" Goswami said. There are thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS interested in marriage and leading a normal life with dignity, but since they cannot get in touch with like-minded people, their dreams remained unfulfilled. \"It is an excellent idea to have this website as marriages between an HIV- positive couple would enable them not only to lead a happy life but also to take care of and support each other, which is very important,\" S.I. Ahmed, head of the AIDS Prevention Society, a community healthcare group in Assam, said. INP+ would arrange pre-marital counselling to prospective couples interested in having children post-marriage. \"When it comes to marriage the couple would surely be told about the pros and cons,\" Ahmed added."

She has no problem in giving out names, even though her brother is HIV positive, and says that it is time people were informed about HIV/AIDS and ways to deal with it. \u201cPeople know only two things about AIDS: it\u2019s incurable and the patient will die soon. This has to change,\u201d she says. Manpreet\u2019s brother was found to be HIV positive on November 2, a day which changed her life forever. \u201cSince the day he has been told about his condition, my brother has simply given up on life. He is not willing to make an effort to get better. Let alone medicines, he isn\u2019t willing to eat. But I have decided that I will fight for and with him,\u201d says she. She adds that more than the reasons which lead to AIDS, it is important to explore the approach one should adopt while dealing with a patient. \u201cMy brother never told me how he got infected. Maybe because I am his younger sister. Frankly, I am least interested in knowing that. Making an issue out of the reasons that lead to this infection is like running after the mosquitoes which bit you.\u201d On Sunday, Manpreet sent her 47-year-old brother back to the rehabilitation centre. He has been addicted to painkillers since past 15 years. He had come to live with his family in Dehradun after working in various cities and when in October his health started decorating, he was taken to the hospital. \u201cAt the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centre, we were informed that his was a very serious case and that the therapy should be started immediately. However, I wasn\u2019t told how to take care of him at home. I called up the toll free number (18001801200) mentioned outside the centre and asked them each and everything,\u201d says Manpreet, who is in touch with many foreign organizations that work for AIDS patients. Her brother, who was initially not willing to come out and talk to the correspondent, later, changed his mind. He said he worked at a Gurudwara in Gorakhpur and due to the hectic work schedule, he turned to addictive drugs. \u201cI had to wake up at around 3 am to open the Guru Granth Sahib and had to be present at the temple till 12 or 1 pm. It was very hectic and I was not getting any rest. So I started having painkillers to help myself cope with the job. I use to take more than 20 tablets a day. The medicines are not sold without a doctor\u2019s prescription so I had bribed a doctor.\u201d Manpreet was pleased to know that her brother wanted to get rid of his addiction. He even agreed to join a rehabilitation center. \u201cBut ever since he came to know that he was HIV positive, he decided that he won\u2019t go anywhere and will die,\u201d she says. Statistics available with the state health department indicate that above 90% of the affected people in Uttarakhand were those who had earlier migrated to other cities in search of jobs. According to government records, a total of 3,500 HIV positive people in the state are presently registered at various ART centres and a total of 1,810 are taking free treatment. Close to 40 NGOs are currently working in the field of HIV/AIDS in the hill state."

        "body": "PANAJI: Goa has finally included children infected with or living with HIV as a disadvantaged section under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. This is expected to provide protection to these children from being denied admission and from being expelled from schools. In 2014, the plight of HIV-infected children in the state came to light when 13 HIV-infected orphans were expelled from a school in Rivona after parents of other students discovered their condition and demanded they not be allowed to study in the school. The students also had to change schools twice due to the objection raised by parents of other children. When a Delhi-based NGO petitioned the Supreme Court, and the apex court ruled in March this year that states include HIV-infected children in the disadvantaged group under RTE, the Goa government was forced to act on those lines. While the court had appreciated 11 states and union territories for already including HIV-infected children as a disadvantaged group, it turned out Goa was among the states that had not protected these children under the RTE Act, even though Goa notified its RTE rules seven years ago, in 2010. The state finally issued the notification in September this year. The extension of protected status to children in Goa living with or infected with HIV means that they are now entitled to special protection and measures under the terms of the RTE Act. These include eradication of discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. It will eliminate discrimination in relation to the admissions process including denying or limiting access to any benefits of enrolment or through segregation in separate study, sports, playground or canteen areas or in any other amenities provided by the school. The disadvantaged section will also get protection from financial extortion or forced expenditure and will be entitled to reservation of seats in private institutes."

But more than two decades after the deadly disease was first detected in Chennai, several babies now have a chance of survival into adulthood thanks to medical regimen and better nutrition. When the Indian government began the national Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV patients in 2004, the programme was a godsend to many infected patients who had even given up on the idea of survival. \"Before the ART programme began, morbidity and mortality rate for HIV positive patients were high,\" says Dr P Manorama, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who runs a home for HIV positive children in Chennai. Today, mortality levels have significantly reduced, from 13 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2010, according to the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). But all the medical and financial aid given by the government is not enough to offset the need for emotional support for the patients, especially children infected with HIV. According to statistics furnished by TANSACS, there are 11,197 children living with HIV in the state today and a sizeable number among them are adolescents. Daisy David of World Vision, an NGO working with HIV positive teenagers, says there is a large segment of children born with the disease, who have today reached their adolescence. \"Children living with HIV have the same exposure to society and media as other children,\" she points out. \"They too grow up with ambitions and desires. However, the discussions provided by the government are inadequate. They not only need counseling on career ambitions and how to battle life on the professional front, but also on the changes their bodies undergo and their own desires regarding sex, marriage and companionship.\" Counselling HIV teenagers about marriage and companionship is rather difficult. \"There is need for counsellors who are equipped to handle all kinds of issues and emotions,\" says Dr.Lakshmibai, project director for Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative (TAI). \"Many of them would like to marry non-infected persons, so there is always the issue of acceptance and rejection,\" says Daisy, who had recently attended a workshop for HIV-infected adolescents in Manipur. \"At Manipur, I met a teenaged boy who was battling rejection after his girlfriend found out he was HIV positive. They all had questions as to whether they could have sexual intercourse with non-infected persons, whether the babies born out of such a bonding would also be infected. The very fact that they needed to ask these questions shows that they are not receiving this kind of information or counselling.\" The other issue that social workers stress on is a tailor-made counselling program for drug adherence. According to statistics furnished by the TNSAC, until June 2010, 3,298 people had not returned to their respective ART centres for their regular treatment for a period of one to three months. And 1,192 persons had not returned to the ART centres for treatment in a period of one to three months."

        "body": "CHENNAI: For 32-year-old Anand Natrajan* the biggest shocker of his life came when he realised he had tested positive for HIV. Since he lived in a village, 32 km from Krishnagiri, every visit to the private hospital was agony. Detection, followed by shame and ostracization was what he feared. Plagued by many doubts - Will my children get HIV? What if I get weaker and cannot work? Anand is not alone, there are many like him who want such questions answered. Coming to their rescue are a host of startups, which offer hope and promises to improve the manageability of such conditions. Online pharmacists are proving useful to such patients, who have chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, HIV, asthma, cancer as buying online has its plus points like bulk orders, discounts of 15%-20% to manage their daily dependence on drugs. But for patients with HIV, it helps them overcome social stigma, as their purchases remain a secret. \u201cThere is no human interface, which is a huge comfort factor to some people. We cater to many remote villages in India and people can order in bulk for three-five months and a discreet package arrives at their doorsteps. We also send out refill reminders two-three weeks ahead of time,\u201d Pradeep Dadha, CEO, Netmeds, which got $50 million in funding from a group of investors, including US-based investment firm OrbiMed and MAPE Advisory. . Apart from pharmacists, telemedicine startups like Rxpress, Karma, Olito, Quadia Technoligies are also helping people with HIV access affordable healthcare from remote, rural locations. \u201cOstracisation is a huge fear and with the increase of telemedicine platforms, people are able to better access doctors,\u201d said Jagdeep Gambhir, founder of Rajasthan-based Karma Healthcare, which got undisclosed funding from Austria-based Ennovent Impact Investment Holding. \u201cWe ensure privacy and boost self-confidence. Apart from medical problems, people also want a morale boost - Will I able to work? Will I grow weaker? What if I had an open wound and used a towel?\u201d said Madhur Gopal, CEO, Rxpress, which has 12,000 registered customers. In rural areas, since patients travel long distances for doctor\u2019s consultations, sometimes there is a gap of 6-7 months before the next visit. \u201cPatients need to be educated on the need for strict medical adherence and the side-effects of anti-retrovirals. Since there is a lot of conflicting information about HIV/AIDS online, patients find it useful that they can come to us,\u201d said Gopal. Many patients confuse HIV with communicable diseases like jaundice and chicken pox. So the around-the-clock availability of doctors is another need. At Pune-based Olito, chief executive Rajesh Kumar Singh said that they get the most number of calls in the night and the early hours of the morning."

A six-foot glass wall has been installed at each station demarcating the checked and unchecked areas after studies showed several theft cases near security X-ray machines as well as people passing items through the security barriers. In addition, CCTV cameras have been placed at strategic points to ensure no one can sneak through undetected. \u201cThe stations have been planned better in terms of their design. There is also more space between frisking points and smart card counters, and CCTV positioning has been done to ensure that no area is left undetected,\u201d said deputy commandant Manjit Singh, CISF spokesperson. The Heritage Line stations will also have night-vision cameras. To handle a heavy tourist footfall, CISF personnel deployed on this line have been given special training in soft and communication skills. They have been taught how to speak with an accent and trained to understand British and American accents. They will also advise the tourists on how to take extra care of their baggage in crowded areas. \u201cThese personnel will be able to guide the tourists to their destination,\u201d said Singh. Almost 6,000 CISF personnel have been deployed at stations, depots and other critical points at Delhi Metro. Under phase III, 3,500 personnel will be added, an official said."

        "body": "PANAJI: While those afflicted with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are highly prone to slipping into depression; youth and teenagers are particularly more susceptible to depression if they have no family support. The Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), given free at ART centres of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), is a big succour for persons living HIV, but counsellors and doctors say that counselling them is tough. The level of depression among adolescents and youth is so acute that some have lost their spirit of optimism. An official said HIV-positive youth and teenagers are more likely to lead a depressed life if they have no family support. Sadly, in the case of most of the youth, family ties are missing with one or both parents long dead. The majority are brought up in orphanages. A few are looked after by their extended families. Akash Naik, 23, who was raised in an orphanage since birth \u2014 his parents had left him in the hospital after his HIV status came to light \u2014 has grown so pessimistic that he refuses to believe that anything positive will happen in his life. The ART staff try to boost his morale by telling him about the research under way to invent new drugs to improve quality of life of persons living with HIV, but Akash\u2019s hopes are long lost. \u201cAkash doesn\u2019t even want to consider a possibility that better drugs that can cure HIV will be invented. He is certain that HIV will not leave him till his death,\u201d a counsellor said. Of the 7,000-odd persons registered with the ART Centre of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, maximum numbers are of those in the reproductive age group, a source said and added that most of them are depressed. Agnelo Lobo, 19, a class XII student, has failed to keep pace with studies. He went into depression after he started developing severe side effects of ART. \u201cDue to the illness he has not been able to concentrate. His mother\u2019s second marriage has further upset him. We have advised him to complete his education through correspondence courses,\u201d the official said pointing out that having to lead life without family support increases the probability of depression. \u201cOnce they turn 18, they have nowhere to go. ART lengthens lives and improves quality of life. But, now, the bigger question before them is how to lead a normal life, and that, too, all alone,\u201d he said and added that there has to be some backup plan to enable HIV-positive persons in the reproductive age group to lead a healthy life. For the last few months, Shivanand Azrekar, 25, has been going through bouts of depression. Azrekar is married and has one child and every time he visits the ART centre, the first question he asks the staff is, \u201chow much time do I have?\u201d Despite being put on ART, Azrekar\u2019s condition is deteriorating, the official said. On a positive note, Goa has succeeded in bringing mother-to-child transmission to zero. Also, the ART centre has some help coming its way in treating depressed HIV-positive youth and teenagers. Yuva clinic, a counselling centre, was opened at GMC in October to offer counselling to patients in the age group of 10-19.

        "body": "CHENNAI: Teenagers in schools should be taught about safe sex, including how to use condoms, said Dr Suniti Solomon, who detected the first case of HIV/AIDS in India 25 years ago. In 1986, Dr Solomon, a microbiologist with the Government General Hospital, Chennai, announced that six women sex workers had been found to be infected by the virus. None of the women is alive to tell about the trauma they underwent because of the stigma. \u201cMany things have changed since then. We have drugs that can bring down viral loads. But awareness among youth remains low,\u201d said Dr Solomon, who heads YRG Care, an NGO. Studies in many countries have shown that teens are more likely to have unplanned pregnancies and contract sexually transmitted diseases. \u201cWe have already delayed introduction of sex education in schools,\u201d she said. Many schools in countries like the US, Australia and France promote frank discussions with teenage students on anatomy, puberty, pregnancy and the risks of unprotected sex. The idea is to tell students to wait till they are old enough to experiment. In India, generally parents and teachers are shy to discuss such topics with children. Dr Solomon said that often when she interacts with schoolchildren, their teachers leave the room. She has been conducting such awareness programmes in schools. \u201cMost of the children hadn\u2019t seen a condom. I tell them all about it and also how to use it. I am not encouraging them to have sex. In fact, I tell them to delay or abstain. If they don\u2019t listen to what I say, they will at least know to be safe,\u201d she said. Sex education is a prickly subject despite Unicef spelling out the course module. Dr Solomon said the decline in prevalence of the viral infection had slackened international funding and the National AIDS Control Organization\u2019s programmes. Many NGOs have developed helplines and web-based services as cost-effective ways to reach out to adolescents. \u201cBut we need to shed inhibitions and be open to strengthen our battle against HIV/AIDS,\u201d said Dr Solomon."

        "body": "VARANASI: The migration of people from eastern Uttar Pradesh to big cities has already identified the region among highly sensitive for HIV infection. The city is emerging as a new ground for HIV infections caused by intravenous drug abuse. Director, centre of excellence, National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), Banaras Hindu University, Shyam Sundar said HIV infection is a common trend in north eastern states specially Manipur, but the trend is now seen in Varanasi as well. \u201cAt present around 10 HIV patients are being treated in the ART centre, BHU. They are not backpackers or foreigners but natives of the city, who are youngsters and middle-aged people. Such drug abusers are often seen at ghats and older parts of the city. Mass sharing of the syringe and needle is often a common practice by drug abusers that invites HIV infection. The trend is catching fast which is very unlikely for a city like Varanasi,\u201d Sunder added. The officials of NACO, Varanasi, stated that the entire eastern UP area is turning out to be a highly sensitive zone for HIV infections because of migration from rural to urban slum areas and even metropolitan cities. Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Ghazipur are identified as the highly sensitive districts. Varanasi ranks at number four. Most of these patients are in the age group of 20 to 45 years and bread winners for the families. Almost 90 per cent of the patients belong to lower middle class families and have poor economic conditions. Recently, new ART centres (for first line treatment) have been opened in Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur and the district hospital in Varanasi but the region\u2019s vulnerability towards the HIV infection is not decreasing the number of patients at ART centre, BHU. Around 300 to 350 patients are arriving at the centre every day. NACO nodal centre in BHU is also the ART centre which was formed in 2005. Already emerged as centre of excellence along with only three other ART centres in northern India, it is providing qualitative first line and second line treatment for AIDS. Apart from screening and treatment of HIV patients, the centre boasts of other facilities like integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC), Suraksha Clinic (STD clinic) and counselling centre for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPCTC). \u201cAt present, as many as 15,819 HIV positive patients are registered in the centre. Earlier low turnout of HIV positive people coming for screening and treatment at the centre was troubling the experts, but now we are overcoming this problem by identifying people and arranging meeting with ICTC and other centres. Around 80 per cent of patients are now turning up for treatment,\u201d Sunder added."

        "body": "PANAJI: Goa Congress party spokesman Durgadas Kamat has filed a complaint with Panaji police against BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy for a post on his Facebook fan page over admission of HIV positive students in a Catholic school. Strongly objecting to the post that states: \"The Goa church loves everyone except HIV+ kids,\" Kamat demanded that a FIR be filed against Swamy for \"attempting to create and promote enmity against the Catholic Church\". He said the post is clearly an offence coming within the ambit of Sections 153 and 153-A of the IPC and as it is in cyberspace, an offence needs to be registered against the BJP leader under Section 66A of Information Technology Act. The complaint states that by accusing the church of loving everyone except HIV positive children, Swamy \"has tried to give a communal and political twist to a very sensitive issue by trying to portray the church in Goa as not being sensitive towards HIV positive orphans\". The issue pertains to admission of 13 HIV positive students from a community care centre run by Catholic nuns in Sanguem taluka. As nearby schools did not admit the students, a school in Sulcorna run by Salesian priests volunteered to admit the children but as parents of other students objected, they were not admitted. When parents objected to the children's admission in another school, this time in Rivona, the children were denied admission here too. The controversy in the last three weeks is over the admission of 23 orphans who grew up with the HIV positive students in the same community care centre. Stating that the BJP leader has made an insensitive statement without knowing facts, Kamat pointed out that the community care centre where these children are being taken care of is run by church institutions. Kamat in the complaint said that the post on Swamy's page is trying to influence public opinion against the minority community \"and communalize and politicize a sensitive issue under the garb of public service\". Panaji police said they have received the complaint and are studying the matter. As for the sections of IPC and IT Act mentioned in the complaint, an official at the Panaji police station said, \"We will have to talk to our superiors.\""

        "body": "HYDERABAD: Contaminated syringes and blood products, blood transfusion and dialysis are inflicting scores of people with the dreaded HIV as they walk out hospitals, diagnostic labs and blood banks in Telangana. State health department officials said 72 people had contracted the virus in 2017, while 100 were afflicted with it in 2016 through reuse and exposure to contaminated syringes, blood transfusion and exposure to blood products. An official, however, privately admitted that the figures could be much more as several patients remain unaccounted due to poor screening methods as well as HIV infection through dialysis, which is not taken into account in state figures. \u201cPatients, who undergo haemo dialysis, are highly vulnerable to hepatitis C, B and HIV, if adequate aseptic measures are not in place during dialysis. There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,\u201d pointed out Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president Helping Hand Foundation, an NGO which works with HIV patients. Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV. \u201cThe Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,\u201d Askari pointed out. Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state. Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations. \u201cFor ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,\u201d T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, NTR Trust Blood Bank, said. Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by National Aids Control Organization (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. \u201cThe ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,\u201d Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. \u201cSo far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,\u201d he added. Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. \u201cUsually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,\u201d say insiders."

        "body": "GUWAHATI: Immunity disorder HIV/AIDS, the most dreaded ailment of the Nineties, is still a threat in the state, especially in rural areas, but what is alarming is the drop in awareness levels. People infected with the disease suppress it for fear of ostracism instead of seeking medical assistance. Awareness about the ailment convincing patients to go to health centres has sadly gone down. The Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS) on Wednesday acknowledged that the level of awareness about HIV/AIDS has plummeted in Assam in the last few years. Manvendra Pratap Singh, incumbent project director, said one of the reasons for the drop in awareness could be the perceived notion that HIV/AIDS is not as scary as before because of the availability of drugs and antiretroviral therapy (ART). \"The risk groups should be the focus areas of campaign. The fear psychosis attached to HIV/AIDS is dwindling in comparison to the Nineties. We don't see much awareness programmes on TV these days. There is a need to mobilise resources and increase awareness. In rural Assam, people don't want to disclose their HIV status,\" said Singh. The first case of AIDS in Assam was reported over two decades ago. But even today, comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS, especially among women in the age group of 15 and 49, is abysmal, according to a study by the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) released this year. The study revealed only 9.4% women in that age group had comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. The term 'comprehensive knowledge' means a woman adopting measures to check the chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS through consistent use of contraceptives and having one uninfected, faithful sexual partner. The 9.4% figure cuts a sorry picture vis-a-vis states and UTs like Andhra Pradesh (29%), Goa (34.6%), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (28.2%), Manipur (40.7%), Sikkim (25.5%) and Tripura (28%). Bihar and Meghalaya have also scored miserably on the comprehensive knowledge count with figures of 10.1% and 13.3%, respectively. Till September 2015, 38% HIV positive cases were detected from Kamrup (Metro) followed by Cachar, Dibrugarh and Nagaon districts. From Kamrup (Metro) district alone, 4,268 HIV positive cases were detected till September 30, 2015. The rate of increase in annual new HIV infections is the highest in Assam and Tripura."

        "body": "Patna: The Patna Network of People Living with HIV/Aids has alleged that government hospitals in Bihar have been denying surgeries to patients with HIV for long, and that the state government is not unaware of it. The Network cites the death of a 45-year-old woman suffering from intestinal obstruction at the Patna Medical College & Hospital (PMCH) in 2012, four days after being admitted to the premier hospital. Gyan Ranjan of the Network attributes her death to denial of surgery for her abdomen-related complaint despite the media highlighting her story. Sources said the government ordered a probe into her death, but the probe panel found no one guilty. It, however, recommended that patients with HIV be operated in government hospitals every Saturday. The idea was that the OTs after such surgeries would be properly fumigated the next day being a Sunday before being used for surgeries on non-HIV patients on Monday onwards till Friday. Asked if PMCH had slotted a specific day for surgeries on patients with HIV, PMCH superintendent Dr Lakhindra Prasad replied in the negative. He, however, told TOI earlier this week, \"Surgeries are performed on patients with HIV as and when required.\" Persons with HIV apart, even their children remain a neglected lot. All persons with HIV and their children are given anti-retroviral drugs to prevent the virus in their body from multiplying. Children are prescribed special drugs for the purpose. However, many ART centres have reported non-availability of these drugs with them. Sources on Thursday told TOI the drugs for such children are out of stock at the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres at Darbhanga Medical College & Hospital in Darbhanga and Anugrah Narain Magdh Medical College & Hospital in Gaya. At the government medical college and hospital in Bhagalpur, only 15 days' stock is left. Experts say this can be dangerous. \"Missing the dose leads to further weakening of the immune system... Also, the virus could become stronger than the drug whenever it is given next,\" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, former member of the Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS). Senior BSACS official B Gupta admits the shortage of drugs. \"We are not getting supplies from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). We are managing things by supplying drugs from one centre to another,\" Gupta told TOI on Thursday. However, NACO's national programme officer B B Rewari blamed it on the state. \"From our end, the supply flow is perfect. The problem is with the state supply chain to districts,\" he said."

On September 26, the woman was admitted to Osmania Hospital with severe stomach pain, police said. \u201cDoctors detected she was in advanced stage of AIDS. After treating her for stomach pain, they discharged her on September 29. She again returned to OGH on October 2 with pain. She was accompanied by her sister, who was told by doctors about her deteriorating condition. She was treated at the outpatient wing. She along with her sister stayed put in the waiting hall for the night,\" the inspector said. Around 12.15 am, she spoke to her sister at length, requesting her to take care of her daughter. After her sister fell asleep, she went to an abandoned shed behind the OP Block and committed suicide by hanging herself from a pipe with a sari, the inspector said. Though there were allegations from her family that the AIDS-afflicted woman ended her life as she was not admitted as an in-patient, police said there was no such complaint. \u201cOn Wednesday night, doctors asked her to come back for review on October 9. Since the auto fare will be high at night, family members decided to wait till morning at the hospital. In the interim period, the woman ended her life.In the complaint, there was no allegation against hospital staff,\" the inspector said. Police registered a case under section 174 (suspicious death) of CrPC and doctors, who performed the autopsy , said she died due to hanging. OGH superintendent Dr GVS Murthy refuted the allegations by her family, saying there was no question of treatment being denied. \u201cWe have been giving advanced treatment and even complex surgeries are performed on HIVAIDS patients. Although, I have not gone through medical records of the particular patient, it's false that we denied treatment to any HIV patient. Currently, police is investigating the case.

The monthly expense of Rs 1,000 per child given by the government is also meager to meet their daily needs. \u201cWe are forced to collect money through donations which help us spend Rs 2,000 per girl,\u201d said a GNSP+ office bearer. Businessman comes to girls\u2019 rescue A local businessman, Mahesh Savani, has offered to provide accommodation to the orphaned girls. \u201cThe place I have offered them is safe and they will not face any discrimination here,\u201d said Savani. The girls will shift to the new place in a few days."

Students went round the coaches of the HIV/AIDS awareness campaign train of the Indian Railways and showed keenness to learn about various aspects, prevention and treatment of the disease. Youths from the district, besides NGO activists, various government employees, members of self-help groups, also visited the train. Sasmita Sahoo, a student of Nehru Centenary Central Hospital, Talcher, said, \"I had heard about the Red Ribbon Express but I had never seen it earlier. I am lucky I got a chance to see the RRE and was able to learn the about reasons behind HIV/AIDS and about precautionary measures to keep the disease at bay.\" Angul has the second highest number of AIDS patients and mortality rate due to the dreaded disease in the state. Altogether 96 persons have died and 826 persons have tested AIDS positive in the district so far. Dr Bichhanda Chandra Pradhan, chief district medical officer was hopeful the RRE will have a positive impact on the people of the district. On the occasion of the special train reaching Angul, a meeting was held at Angul railway station to discuss the AIDS situation in the district. The meet was attended by Dhenkanal MP Tathagata Satapathy, district collector Siba Prsada Mishra, sub-collector Sudarshana Parida, chief district medical officer Bichhanda Chandra Pradhan and other state government officials. Dr Daman Ahuja, chief executive of RRE told TNN: \"The RRE has six coaches and was flagged off in New Delhi as part of its campaign against the HIV/AIDS. The RRE has covered a total of 78 railway stations in 10 states till now in the country.\" He said a total of 30 lakh people have visited the train and were appraised of the disease and its remedy. The train is travelling through 23 states with an objective of creating awareness about HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases like tuberculosis and malaria, he said. The coaches display information about bio-medical aspects of HIV/AIDS, including interactive touch screens, educational material with focus on stigma and discrimination free communities, information on general health and communicable diseases. The first coach of the train is reserved for educating visitors on HIV/AIDS and to disseminate information about preventive measures. The second coach offers treatment facilities while the third one is for sensitizing youth about the disease. The fourth coach is dedicated to information about general diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and the fifth coach provides training to health workers. In the sixth coach there are facilities to provide treatment and counseling of patients and relatives. Ahuja said RRE's target is to create awareness about the disease especially among the youth and women as one-third of the HIV/AIDS patients are from this demographic section. A total of 23 lakh people are found to be carrying the virus in the country at present, he pointed out."

        "body": "MUMBAI: World AIDS Day was marked in the city with protests and marches as people living with HIV took to the streets on Sunday against the short supply of medicines and testing kits. Patient groups and NGOs drafted a charter of demands to be presented to the Union health department and National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). The stock of drugs meant for the national programme to control HIV has been empty in the past two months. Patients are being provided with medicines from an earlier stock and some drugs are bought locally. Since the medicines are scarce and can\u2019t be given out in bulk, patients have to make frequent, often daily, trips to the centres for their drugs, though there is no assurance that they would get them. Some have even stopped visiting the centres because of the daily travel and also because they often have to return empty-handed. \u201cMany HIV-positive children are not living to see their second birthday,\u201d said Eldred Tellis from Mumbai Aids Forum, adding that Maharashtra Aids Control Society had shown little urgency to procure anti-retroviral medicines. Mumbai Aids Forum, a body of HIV patients and NGOs, demanded that the state should keep a buffer stock. \u201cRegular supply of medicines for one to two months should be reinstated,\u201d said Ganesh Acharya, who is living with HIV for 20 years. Tellis cautioned that for patients, who had been going without medication for months, drugs would stop working and the people would end up with an increased viral load. Around 1.80 lakh people in the state are on anti-retrovial treatment. According to Vikas Ahuja from Network of Positive People, red tape in the tendering process has been delaying the procurement of medicines. Moreover, he said, Roche Diagnostics, only supplier for National Aids Control Organisation, had raised the rates of viral testing kits and the state was not willing to pay. JJ Hospital\u2019s ART centre does not have the viral load testing facility for almost a year. \u201cThe viral load test reports are imperative to start patients on second-line treatment,\u201d said Ahuja. While there has been reports of loss of lives due to lack of treatment, MSACS said all they know is that 50,000 people are lost to follow up. A NACO official told TOI that a drugs stock-out may not happen again. \u201cWe provide 15 drugs. Besides the supply for paediatric syrup, we have adequate stocks,\u201d the official said."

Mukesh Kumar (name changed), a resident of Kanke and a first year student of General Nursing in Midwifery (GNM) at Florence School of Nursing in Irba (20 km from Ranchi) was tested HIV positive at a private testing facility in September last year. According to Kumar, he disclosed this to his college authority and sought a leave of 10 days to recover from devastated mental state. \u201cI returned after 10 days to resume my classes but the principal asked me to take more time and take further leave if necessary,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cI took that in good faith but urged to continue with classes when I was informed that I cannot attend classes anymore,\u201d he added. The college authorities said the ban was a precautionary measure to avoid contamination among patients through Kumar, who as a part of his nursing curriculum provides medical care to the ailing. Despite the ban, Kumar kept persuading the college management but failed. Kumar sought a meeting with chief minister Raghubar Das after January, but did not get through. \u201cInstead, his office assured me that everything will be fine and I will be attending classes normally. However, weeks after the CMO\u2019s assurance, I was not let in,\u201d he added. Only this week, the management has cleared Kumar for the theory classes, but has upheld the ban on Kumar\u2019s traveling to the city\u2019s hospitals for his clinical (practical) curriculum (the college does not have a hospital and sends students to city\u2019s prominent hospitals for practical classes)."

As things turned out, she got married and got infected. The husband is no more but there\u2019s her, two children and the virus. In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance. But there is something to be said about sheer grit. If you have it, even gunny bags can give you a lease of life. In Sangeeta\u2019s case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious \u2013 dignity. The feisty lady has received a bulk contract from a Kalka-based company to sew gunny bags for Rs 4,000 month. On World Aids Day, nine women living with AIDS joined her to make a living sewing gunny bags. She calls women living with AIDS on her mobile phone. One, she proudly points out, she bought herself. At 31, Saumya is treading the same path. Like Sangeeta, Saumya lost her husband, who was HIV positive. Unlike Sangeeta, the legacy she received included not only HIV but also TB. It was not possible for her to work anywhere till people from the drop-in-centre approached her to help her earn by stitching gunny bags. She is also trying to reach out to women deprived of care when they need it the most. \u201cI have seen the vicissitudes of life and I am trying to guide women suffering the same way,\u201d she said. It was Archana, in-charge of the drop-in-centre who conceived the idea of helping women with the craft of making polybags. Archana, who lives with AIDS herself, plans to expand operations to include more women in the ambit of the self-sustaining group. \u201cWe went to Anandpur Sahib a few days ago where we saw women working on recycled paper for a well known company. Though the marketing was not impressive, it generated Rs 1,500 per month. We decided to modify the concept and raise income for the women,\u201d she said. While the centre has a special machine to imprint the names that buyers want, they also plan to buy a machine which can be used to make disposable cups and glasses. \u201cWith these self employment schemes, we will expand services to all 100 women living with HIV in the city,\u201d said Archana."

But the government is not giving up yet. In its latest move, the government has decided to rope in folk artistes and magicians who will work as messengers to make the people aware about the global scourge. Altogether 12 districts Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Chittorgarh, Rajsamand, Jodhpur, Barmer and Sriganganagar have been identified as high prevalent and around 80 artistes will campaign in these places during the drive organised by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society. \"The awareness drive would touch entire state but we have identified these districts for our awareness drive in the first phase as cases of AIDS are higher in the 12 districts identified in comparison to the other districts of the state. These districts are on priority and some of them have high migrant population,\" joint-director of Information Education Communication (IEC) Dr Pradeep Chawdhary said. For the past four days, the folk artistes were busy rehearsing their programme here. Apart from the artistes, magicians and puppeteers would also spread the social message. Highlighting his show for the campaign, Udaipur-based magician M Lal said, \"Through magic, I will turn a colour book into a black book to spread the message to the people that AIDS could destroy your colourful life. Also, I will show the people how we can keep ourselves safe from the disease.\" Folk singer from Bikaner Meer Razak Ali said, \"I will perform in Bikaner and so will each folk artist in the area to which he or she belongs.\"Ali stressed that the main aim of the folk artistes is to spread the message among adolescents and youths, who are more vulnerable to HIV saying they have lack of adequate information, authentic sources of information and but with all curiosity to experiment. About one third of the AIDS cases has been found to be afflicting young people in the age group of 15-29 years."

As per the circular, women who are HIV-affected or involved in paid sex would be given loans, so as to help them take up economic activities for self-employment. This loan would be provided on the basis of the eligibility after the beneficiaries produce medical certificate issued by a government doctor, it said. The loans would be sanctioned after the proposal in this regard presented through District Manager of Chhattisgarh Mahila Kosh gets approved by the District Collector concerned, it said.

They tied the nuptials in the presence of close family and friends in the city on Wednesday, that was World AIDS Day. The couple\u2019s happiness was evident. \u201cNow I have a company. I have somebody to look after and be looked after by. No one can give you better support than your wife,\u201d said Santosh, who works as a security guard. A few years ago, he lost his first wife to HIV, and he had to hand over his 10-year-old daughter to her grandparents in Mumbai. Geetanjali, a widow, who had to face prejudice in the household once her in-laws found out about her condition in 2002, chose to settled down despite her circumstances. \u201cI have been independent right from the beginning. I have been earning my own money and have never depended on my parents or siblings for anything. But it was my mother\u2019s unwavering support that helped me take the decision to settle down once again. I want to remain self-reliant, come what may,\u201d said Geetanjali, who works at a tuberculosis centre in Hadapsar. Her 11-year-old son, from her previous marriage, will live with the couple. \u201cWe have decided not to have children. My wife and I are going to take care of each other, follow a disciplined lifestyle and lend each other as much moral and emotional support possible,\u201d said Santosh. Disha, an initiative by Deep Griha Society to help HIV-positive people, was instrumental in organising the matrimonial meet in August. Santosh and Geetanjali also sought pre-marital counselling with Disha. \u201cThat day, some 12 couples announced their plans to marry. Santosh and Geetanjali are one of the first to get married. For the last few months, they were being counselled on treatment, medication and healthy living,\u201d said Avinash Chakranarayan, coordinator of Disha. The couple wants to pass on a positive message to people living with HIV. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with this condition. Consider yourself as normal and healthy and continue living whole-heartedly. Young HIV-positive people should certainly consider getting married. It\u2019s your positive attitude that will make all the difference,\u201d said Geentajali. Names changed to protect identities."

Presently, he is joint secretary of Allahabad Network For People Living with HIV/AIDS Society working among the people infected with the AIDS. He meets such AIDS-affected people regularly and inspires them to lead a happy and harmonious life. He knows the discrimination and trauma an infected person has to face in society and believes a happy and positive frame of mind can help face the disease bravely. Giving information about the trauma his family had to face, he said he was only 23 years of age when HIV virus was detected in his blood. The moment he was diagnosed with AIDS, the private nursing home forced his family members to take the young boy from the hospital. People from a cross-section of the society thronged in large numbers at Allahabad railway junction to see the Red Ribbon Express. People from rural areas also thronged in large numbers to see the train and get acquainted with facts about the dreaded disease. Volunteers in the train answered various queries of the people. DTO Dr OP Shahi informed Ribbon Express received about 50,000 visitors in Allahabad on Friday and Saturday. About 60 persons donated blood during the programme."

Every donated unit of blood is tested for diseases such as HIV and hepatitis viruses. The ones with infections are called, counselled and put through another round of HIV-testing. But in Mumbai there is a gap between numbers who test positive and those who return for counselling and treatment, said MDACS officials. In 2016-17, 0.29% of the blood from banks was positive for HIV. Given the new WHO call to put every HIV-positive person on treatment at the earliest to ensure a better quality of life, MDACS increased efforts to find HIV-positive persons and start them on treatment. It issued a circular on June 5 advising blood banks on how to take the history of blood donors and how to counsel them. Blood banks have to retest any blood unit that tests positive for HIV and call the donor for a retest and counselling session at the nearest government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC). \u201cBut in practice, such donors never return to the centres. There is a significant gap between positive sample detected and donors who return for a confirmation,\" said asenior doctor. MDACS additional project director Dr Shrikala Acharya has written that in collaboration with American Center\u2019s for Diseases Control, India has initiated an exercise to assess reasons for this discordance. \u201cIt has also been decided that such donors should be referred to any ICTC they are comfortable to visit,\" said Dr Acharya."

The breakthrough was reported in the science journal Science Translational Medicine after it had been tested on 18 AIDS patients. But the scientists at Hanover university hospital or MHH in northern Germany said they have yet to find a way to put the substance, VIR-576, in a pill. All the test patients received it as an intravenous drip. Variants of the new therapy could also be devised to fight measles, hepatitis C and Ebola disease, they said. VIR-576 is a protein that smothers human immunodeficiency virus, stopping it docking with cells in the human body. \"It is a completely new therapy approach which we hope will reduce side effects,\" said Reinhold E Schmidt of MHH. Other existing medicines offered since the mid-1990s work by proofing cells of the body against the virus. \"Our peptide works on the virus, not on the cells, so some of the side-effects won't happen at all,\" he said. Current anti-AIDS medications ensure an almost normal life span for HIV-infected people but raise the risk of strokes and liver damage. VIR-576 caused some diarrhoea, but no other major side effects, the tests suggested. Schmidt cautioned that it could take years before VIR-576 was available from pharmacies as a medicine.

As if the trauma of losing their parents to HIV/AIDS at a tender age was not enough, neighbours had closed their doors on these HIV-positive orphans. Facing protest and discrimination from neighbours, the girls had to vacate their special home \u2014 an apartment in Puna area of the city. This is when a city-based businessman extended a helping hand \u2014 Mahesh Savani of PP Savani Group offered his plush farmhouse to accommodate these girls. Today, these girls, whose number has grown to 49, not only enjoy their accommodation at the farmhouse but also pursue their education in a school near by. Since last one year the girls have not suffered from any infection, which was otherwise routine for them. \u201cHIV/AIDS medicines of six girls have been discontinued as their CD4 counts have improved and they are in a better condition. These girls now believe that they are not just patients but also human beings,\u201d says Savani. He has even named his farmhouse \u2018Janani Dham\u2019. CD4 cells, also known as T-helper cells, are a type of white blood cells that fight infection. At their previous shelter, these girls were banned from playing in the residential campus. Following objections, Gujarat State Network for Positive People (GSNP+), the NGO taking care of the girls, was forced to relocate the girls. But with limited budget they had no other option than to ask government for accommodation facility. After Savani offered his farmhouse, these girls have a sprawling garden and a play area equipped with a couple of rides for their recreation. \u201cLiving in a lush green area has helped create positivity among them and it has improved their health. No major infections as well as improvements in CD4 count reflect their healthy condition. They can now access good education and meet other citizens regularly,\u201d says Daksha Patel, vice-president of GSNP+. Savani is now planning to accommodate HIV+ widows at the same farmhouse. \u201cIf things move ahead as planned, we will soon support HIV+ women by offering them home at \u2018Janani Dham\u2019.

In an RTI response, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has revealed that 2,234 people across the country got transfused with HIV-infected blood in the same period, raising serious concerns about blood safety. Uttar Pradesh recorded the maximum number of transfusion transmitted HIV cases at 361 followed by Gujarat at 292 cases. Delhi grabbed the fourth position with 264 cases. Maharashtra has recorded more than 1,239 such cases over the last six years. While activists are alarmed with the findings, NACO insisted that the data is not a real indicator as it is based on voluntary disclosure by clients at the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC). A senior NACO official told TOI, \u201cThe numbers are self-reported. It\u2019s not corroborated further by following up with blood tests. The overall situation is actually much better now. In 1999, transfusion transmitted HIV was 15%, which has now come down to less than 1%.\u201d The official added that the issue of safe blood can be best addressed with an Act that most developed nations have. The Maharashtra State Aids Control Society said that most clients at the ICTC give a history of blood transfusion even if they have indulged in unsafe sex or injecting drugs. \u201cThe fact is that at least 90% of HIV transmissions still occur through sexual intercourse,\u201d said Dr Shobhna Tehra, joint director of the society. A doctor, who has been crusading for safe blood, said that the government has not showed any urgency to bring in advanced tests, such as nuclear acid testing, that cut down the HIV detection window period to six days from three months. \u201cThey are risking the life of poor patients. The worst hit are thalassemia patients who have to take regular transfusions,\u201d said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Tehra said that the department is working on a proposal for NAT in NACO-supported blood banks in Maharashtra."

So far, Gujarat State Network Of People Living With HIV-AIDS, has been instrumental in number of matchmakings in Gujarat. Now, the network is organizing a state-wide matchmaking meet in mid-December for which the registration has already started. The officials said that every year, around 15 to 20 marriages take place where both the partners are HIV-positive.For the meet, they have already got around 50 applications."

        "body": "For 45-year-old Siriyapushpam, a daily wage labourer who earns `100 a day, falling ill costs her dear. The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day\u2019s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time. Siriyapushpam\u2019s case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN. It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover. According to \u2018India HIV Estimation 2015\u2019 report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN\u2019s prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%. \"I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,\" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women\u2019s Network. According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised. HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven\u2019t received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. \"In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,\" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance. Star Health & Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count. \"Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,\" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance. Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. \"With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,\" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance. But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to \u20b930,000 per family per year. While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day\u2019s income. Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. Dr P Kuganathan, a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine & infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, \"Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,\" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV. In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients. A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART."

National AIDS control organization (NACO) has given its consent as it believes that the truckers from all the three adjoining states have their transit here. Talking about the recent approval by the NACO, Dr Vanita Gupta, project director State Aids Control Society (SACS) said, \"Earlier this group of high risk in the city was refused as it was not included in the long distance driving. However, it has been now included in the NACO's mapping. They were convinced that all these migrants coming from Himachal, Punjab and Haryana halt in the city.\" As per the latest data on the Aids by the SACS, there were 68 cases in the city in 2010 which shot up to 93 last year. There are 12 target intervention groups which are high risk for HIV. \"In the migrants category we had labourers only. But from next month we will start headcount of truck drivers who can be at risk. This particular group has been recognized as the most vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases all across the country,\" said Dr Gupta. There has bee no survey till now on the truck drivers. \"Transport chowk area is the hub of such migrants who commute on regular basis to the adjoining states. This migrant category needs sensitization which can now be possible,\" said Sandeep Mittal, who will manage this project. For the overall reduction in the epidemic, targeted interventions are aimed to effect behaviour change through raising awareness among the high risk groups. It has been researched that truckers are a critical group. Their living and working conditions, sexually active age and separation from regular partners for extended periods of time predispose them to paid sex or sex with non-regular partners. \"These interventions build awareness among the spouses of truckers and migrant workers, women aged 15 to 49 and children affected by HIV or vulnerable population groups,\" said Dr Gupta."

Justice D Hariparanthaman, allowing the plea of the driver who tested positive for HIV in January 2010, said: \u201cIt is settled that the transport corporation is bound to provide alternative employment, if the medical board finds that he could not do heavy work. It is admitted that the petitioner is an AIDS patient and the medical board found that he could discharge light duties.\u201d The driver joined the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation\u2019s Salem division as a daily wager in May 1998 and in September 1999 his services were regularised. After an unblemished service for more than 11 years, he started falling ill frequently. In January 2010 he tested positive for HIV and began treatment at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. He was unable to discharge his regular duties due to his illness and was forced to take all the available leave. The management initiated punitive action against him for unauthorised absence from March 12, 2011. His representation to the authorities that his continued absence was due to his medical condition and action against him be dropped fell on deaf ears, as he was directed to appear before the corporation medical officer for examination. On October 15, 2011, the medical officer of the corporation examined him and found him \u2018not fit\u2019 for the driver\u2019s job. He immediately approached the Madras high court invoking Section 47 of the Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, seeking alternative employment with pay protection. After this petition was filed, he was referred to a medical board at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. On April 9, 2012, the board found that he could not do heavy work, but could be used for light work. When the matter was taken up for hearing, the management informed the court that appropriate orders would be passed soon on the basis of the medical board\u2019s report. Justice Hariparanthaman, however, cited the mandatory duty of the management under the PWD Act and said the driver should be provided with alternative employment within two weeks, and his pay too should be protected by the authorities."

They do not have to go to the mandal revenue officers (MROs) for the sum of Rs 200 anymore. While the pension scheme for People Living with HIV/Aids (PLHAs) was introduced last year through the department of rural development akin to other development schemes, over half of the patients were not accessing it. The PLHAs had claimed that they were not able to utilise the pension scheme because of apprehensions of stigma and discrimination at the time of verification by MROs and requested the government to review the process for implementing the scheme. After a proposal in this regard was sent to the state government by the AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs), on December 9 this year, GO 344 was issued by the state government, giving permission for disbursement of pension to the beneficiaries through ART centres. According to Apsacs officials, individuals who have Aids and are receiving ART are eligible for the pension. However, to be eligible for the pension, one should have been on ART for a minimum of three months, possess a white ration card and `Sahara' identity cards issued by Apsacs."

        "body": "LONDON: British scientists are on the verge of confirming a treatment for HIV, an incurable virus that leads to deadly AIDS disease, if a new treatment trial proves successful, a media report claimed on Sunday. A British man with HIV hopes to become the first in the world to be cured of the disease by using the pioneering new therapy designed to eradicate the virus, 'The Sunday Times' reported. The 44-year-old is the first of 50 people to complete a trial of the ambitious treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from five of Britain's leading universities - universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, University College London and King's College London. It is the first therapy created to track down and destroy HIV in every part of the body \u2014 including in the dormant cells that evade current treatments. If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for HIV and could save millions of pounds spent on drugs. Early tests show the virus is undetectable in the man's blood. But he will have to wait some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease. It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease. Mark Samuels, managing director of the National Institute for Health Research Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure, which set up the medical consortium, told the newspaper: \"This is one of the first serious attempts at a full cure for HIV. We are exploring the real possibility of curing HIV. This is a huge challenge and it's still early days but the progress has been remarkable.\" The HIV virus is mostly transmitted by sex. Once in the body it targets T-cells, part of the immune system, splicing itself into their DNA. If the T-cell is active the HIV hijacks it, turning it into a tiny factory spewing millions more viruses to infect other T-cells. It is this aspect of HIV activity that is targeted and suppressed by anti-retroviral therapies (ART). What ART cannot do is pick out the millions of infected T-cells lying dormant around the body -- but waiting to spring into life should ART fail. It is the HIV reservoir in these dormant cells that the research group is targeting. \"It would be great if a cure has happened. My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus. However, that could be the anti-retroviral therapies, so we have to wait to be sure,\" the London-based patient said. The new trial is being backed by the UK's state-funded National Health Service (NHS) because it could save millions by removing the need to treat HIV patients with ART, which costs around 380,000 pounds per person over their lifetime."

It, however, cannot escape the fact that seven persons die of the infection every month in the state. Until September this year, the disease had claimed the lives of 61 persons\u201438 men and 23 women. The statistics were similar for the preceding year. GSACS data reveals that 745 persons\u2014515 men and 230 women\u2014died of AIDS between 2001 and 2010, an average of just above six a month. Integrated counseling and testing centre (ICTC) counselor Supriya Arolkar said seven deaths a month is an acceptable average. \u201cTimely and better anti-retroviral treatment and precautions taken by HIV infected persons have reduced deaths. The number could have been more otherwise,\u201d Arolkar said. Given this, GSACS project director Dr Pradeep Padwal said the society\u2019s aim is to bring HIV and AIDS cases to zero. \u201cWe have a dream that there will be no new infections five years from now and there would be zero AIDS deaths. We are working towards this through creating awareness,\u201d Padwal said. Padwal presents data to show that the incidence of HIV is on the decline in Goa since 2008. While around 954 persons were infected with HIV in 2008, it dropped to 901 in 2009 and to 769 in 2010. He also said 105 HIV infected persons in 2008, 184 in 2009 and 154 in 2010 developed into AIDS cases. Up to September 2011, 536 people had tested positive for HIV and 81 were living with AIDS. HIV takes several years to turn in full-blown AIDS hence those who die of the disease would have contracted the virus years earlier, Padwal said."

The UPASCS officials team while visiting ICTC units, being set up to counsel and treat HIV positive people, have asked the officials of district AIDS Programme Control Unit (DAPCU) to receive feedback from patients once they visit these ICTC units and maintain the records properly. The officials pointed out that the DAPCU officials should also cross check whether a patient, after being tested positive for HIV/AIDS and further being asked to visit ART (Anti-Retro Therapy) centre for treatment, is visiting the centres or not and make efforts to establish proper communication in this regard. The officials further stressed on maintaining proper records. Also, the officials directed to install proper display boards at all ICTC centres so that people coming for tests and counselling don't face any problems. The idea is to generate maximum awareness. A similar record should also be kept for patients registering for counselling. Stressing the need of records, nodal officer, DAPCU, Dr OP Sahi said \"UPSACS officials have strictly mentioned the need to upgrade the facilities at ICTC units and proper maintenance of records\". As a high-powered NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) team is scheduled to visit city on December 9 to monitor the situation, officials of UPSACS and DACPU are running from pillar to post to complete the records. Pointedly, stress has been paid to Allahabad district as it has been placed under sensitive A category list of five districts that includes Banda and Etawah and officials would be taking frequent rounds to take stock of the situation. \"The unprecedented rise in HIV/ AIDS cases has left the authorities perplexed and they have been stressing on to update the records on frequent intervals so that clear picture could be accessed\" said a senior official adding that \"officials would be taking the identified pockets under its scanner and studying the causes behind the increasing rate of HIV transmission.\""

The report 'Adolescents: Under the Radar in the Asia-Pacific AIDS Response', published by the Asia-Pacific Inter-Agency Task Team on Young Key Populations, which includes UNICEF and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS warned that the AIDS epidemic cannot be ended as a public health threat by 2030 without tackling the issue of adolescents. In 2014, 220,000 adolescents aged 10-19 were estimated to be living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific. India is among the 10 countries in the region accounting for 98 per cent of those aged 10 to 19 living with HIV. The other countries are Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Prevalence is particularly high in large cities like Mumbai, Hanoi, Jakarta, Bangkok, Chiang Mai and other urban areas. The 2014 figure accounts for almost 15 per cent of all new cases in the region. Although new infections are falling overall, they are rising among adolescents, coinciding with an increase in risky behaviour, such as multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use. The report, released ahead of World AIDS Day on Tuesday, added that in hotspot urban areas, HIV prevalence can be many times the national prevalence. In general, female sex workers in Asia and the Pacific are 29 times more likely to be living with HIV compared with all women of reproductive age, according to a global systematic review in low and middle-income countries. \"The Asia-Pacific region is facing a hidden epidemic of HIV among adolescents, with an estimated 50,000 new infections in 2014 among those aged 15 to 19,\" the report said calling on governments to develop specifically targeted prevention strategies. Those at highest risk include gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender people, injecting drug users, and people who buy and sell sex. In India, HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is 3.5 per cent for those younger than 25 years while it is 4.9 per cent for men older than 25. HIV prevalence among sex workers under 25 years of age in India was 1.7 per cent for the 2007-2014 period."

As they innocently await a new set of books and uniforms, the nuns who run the home are struggling to find a school willing to admit the children. The problem arose when the nuns approached a school close to the home and the children were refused admission as 14 of them were HIV+. Despite there being two other schools closer to the institute, the nuns then approached a school in Sulcorna, that is about 15km away. The Sulcorna school decided to admit the children, but ran into trouble when parents objected. Sources in the Sulcorna school management said parents of other students objected to HIV+ children sharing space with their children and threatened to pull out their children from the school if the HIV+ children were admitted. ?Some parents even sought school leaving certificates for their children, school sources said. Speaking to TOI, the head of the children's institute said, \"The parents believe that if their children mingle with children with HIV, they would be exposed to the infection.\" To allay such fears, Indian medical association (IMA) Goa state president Dr Jagadish Cacodkar had a session with the school's parent teachers association (PTA) to explain that \"merely mixing with HIV positive persons does not pass the infection\". Some 200 PTA members attended the session and Cacodkar claimed they appeared satisfied with the explanation and reasoning. Cacodkar said the opposition by parents was a result of misconception. \"The main reason parents object is because AIDS is incurable. The psychological fear of contracting a deadly disease coupled with misconception about its transition has compounded their ignorance. Their biggest misconception is that HIV is contagious,\" he said. \"They were explained why it is not possible to get an infection if you touch a HIV positive person, share a seat with one or even when you eat from a common plate,\" he said. Even late Friday evening, the nuns were in talks with the parents and the school management, and remained hopeful that all the children from their home will be admitted. \"I can say that 95% of the problem is sorted out. Consultative efforts to change the outlook of parents seems to be finally yielding results,\" the nun said. Until last academic year the 14 HIV positive children were schooled in the home. It was only this year that, emboldened by the Supreme Court decision in March that asked Central and state governments to end discrimination against HIV positive children during school admission, the nuns decided to admit them in a public school. While they almost succeeded, their attempt was derailed by parents. How HIV spreads The virus can be transmitted only through body fluids like blood, semen or breast milk. HIV cannot spread through saliva, sweat or by touching. The virus finds it hard to survive outside of bodily fluids You cannot catch HIV by Breathing the same air as someone who is HIV+ Hugging, kissing, or shaking hands with someone who is HIV+ Touching a toilet seat or doorknob after an HIV+ person Sharing food with an HIV+ person"

Ganjam district has the highest number of HIV positive people in the state. According to the latest report, the number stands at 8,005. Out of these, 1,365 persons including 62 children (below 14 years of age) are taking ART, medical officer (in-charge of AIDS) B C Mohapatra said. While the main ART centre is functioning at MKCG Medical College and Hospital here, there are four link centres at Aska, Bhanjanagar, Khallikote and Polasara. \"The move will help in the regular check-up and treatment of these children at the ART centres,\" the collector said. The DAPCC, however, has request the government to extend this facility to all persons suffering from AIDS. The state government is now providing a monthly allowance of Rs 200 per HIV person, irrespective of their age limit. In Ganjam district, there are 3,824 persons benefitting by the scheme. The district administration has also decided to stock the kits to administrate pregnant mothers only during the delivery time in the hospital, if there is short supply of such kits from the Orissa State AIDS Control Organisation (OSACO). Preventive medicines are administered to pregnant women during delivery under the Prevention of Parent to Child (PPTC) programme. This stops the passing of HIV infection from the mother to the child during delivery. But on many occasions, deliveries take place without it due to short supply of kits. \"To overcome such a situation, we have decided to purchase kits worth around Rs 50,000 from the District Red Cross fund,\" the collector said."

        "body": "As per the United Nations 2011 statistics, the occurrence rate of AIDS in India has reduced by almost 50 per cent in the last 10 years. This can be attributed primarily to the efforts of the many anti-AIDS campaigns promoted by the government and non-government (NGOs and private organizations) bodies. It is only through proper education and communication programmes that awareness on AIDS prevention can be created. Today we've got a few must-know facts about AIDS that will help you understand the condition, its origins and spread. HIV and AIDS: HIV or the human immunodeficiency virus is a lenti virus that infects the cells of the immune system and impairs their functions. Infection by the virus causes the gradual breakdown of the body\u2019s ability to ward off infections and diseases. Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, is the most advanced stage of HIV infection wherein, the body is infected by more than 20 opportunistic diseases or HIV-related cancers. History and origin: It is believed that the disease first came from chimpanzees during a hunting incident in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the 1930s. However, it was only in the early 1980s that the term AIDS was first coined and introduced. Originally, it was thought that the condition is prevalent only among homosexuals. But later, reports and researches made it evident that the infection can occur in heterosexuals as well. Statistics: As per World Health Organization statistics, more than 2 million people across the world die every year due to HIV/AIDS. Due to this, the condition is regarded as the world\u2019s number one infectious killer affecting mainly low and middle income countries. Areas of prevalence: The region having the largest incidence of HIV infection is Africa with an estimated 21-28 million people suffering from the condition. Apart from this, certain regions in Asia and Eastern Europe including India also have a strong proportion of HIV victims. Countries like Russia and Ukraine also have a large number of HIV victims and people suffering from AIDS. HIV-infection progression: The time required for HIV-infected persons to develop AIDS varies widely. According to UN AIDS reports, majority of people infected with the virus develop signs of HIV-related illness within 5 to 10 years if not treated at the earliest. However, the durations between the HIV infection and the actual development of AIDS can be 10-15 years and sometimes even longer. Mother to child transmission: Although infection can spread from mother to child, current recommendations indicate that this can be avoided entirely with the help of preventive medicines and procedures. However, access to such preventive interventions is low in certain developing low income nations. Another way to achieve this is by avoiding the process of breast feeding and opting for replacement feeding methods.

A team of researchers at the the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US created the drug, known by the acronym DRACO, which homes in on infected cells and makes them self-destructive . Its hit list includes human rhinoviruses - the bugs that causes colds in adults and in children - flu, polio, a stomach bug and deadly dengue fever. But DRACO is also expected to zap measles and German measles, cold sores, rabies and even HIV - and could be on pharmacy shelves in a decade, the Daily Mail reported. Lead researcher Mike Rider said, \"It's certainly possible that there's some virus that we aren't able to treat but we haven't found it yet.\" In lab tests, DRACO killed 15 viruses. It also saved the lives of mice given a dose of flu that would have killed them."

But the would be in-laws of his sister have stopped taking their calls since the news of HIV infections in Premganj and two adjoining villages made headlines. When Mukesh tried to contact them through a mediator, they called off the match. \u201cNo one in my family is infected, but moving away seems to be the only option left for us. Otherwise who will marry my siblings, including four sisters?\u201d Mukesh asked. Shivam (45), a class-IV civic employee, lives with his mother (80). Both tested negative for HIV, but he feels ostracised by relatives. Life is no better at work either. \u201cMy colleagues have started ignoring me,\u201d he said.

        "body": "JAIPUR: At least 25,638 People Living with HIV (PLHIV) registered with Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) are 'untraceable'. As per RSACS, these people are registered at antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres but they are not coming to take their medicine. The figures show that there are 48,202 PLHIV patients registered at 17 ART centres in the state. Since more than half of the registered persons at ART centres are giving treatment a miss, it has become a cause of concern for RSACS. Now, the health department plans to find out the actual status of all the registered PLHIV at the ART centres. RSACS director Dr S S Chauhan said, \"There could be a possibility of many PLHIVs getting them registered at different ART centres. So there is a chance that a single PLHIV can be registered at more than once ART centre. And that could be mean that the number of registered PLHIV is more than actual number. Also, there could be those who shifted to other states and are taking treatment there.\" Taking a serious note of the 'untraceable' PLHIV, the RSACS will start a campaign to locate the them by conducting a line listing. An RSACS official said line listing will help them find the actual number of PLHIV, who were once tested positive at the ART centres. The official said they would conduct a survey by visiting the houses of the PLHIV to know the actual position. He said that the survey would help them get the actual PLHIV number and also it would encourage PLHIV to take medicines available at ART centres. He added that few PLHIV do not require medicines so they do not come to ART centres. \"The survey would clear the picture of the patients' status in the state,\" he said."

        "body": "BHOPAL: Reshma (named changed) was admitted to Hamidia Hospital for treatment in June. Like any responsible AIDS patient, she reported her condition to the hospital. Few hours into her stay at the government hospital, she not only had to fight AIDS, but the stigma attached to it. \"Discrimination is widespread, the nurse refused to give me an injection, fearing she would get infected,\" she said. Across the state, it will be hard to find hospitals that will do the operation or surgical procedure on AIDS victims or HIV positive persons, alleged Rajpal Shekhawat of Madhya Pradesh network people (MPNP), an organisation formed by AIDS affected victim and families. According to estimates, there are 28,548 adults (till Oct 2012) identified as HIV positive in Madhya Pradesh. The situation is even worse at the district level. It's been 6 months since 25-year-old Anand (named changed) has had a accumulation of water in his chest, after an accident. The local hospital refused to conduct an operation after they learnt Anand was HIV positive, said Shekhawat. Some of the AIDS victims do find care, but it comes at a hefty price. A 45-year-old woman from Alirajpur was operated upon in a private hospital in Indore. She required support plates for fracture repair. She paid the price for being the AIDS victim, said Shekhawat. Even if hospitals operate or admit AIDS patients for treatment, they face many inequalities. \"AIDS victims are told to get their own bed-sheets, plastic-mats and, at times, even drinking water glasses,\" he added. This year, the World AIDS Day theme is 'Getting to Zero'. \"Zero discrimination of AIDS patients by the medical fraternity is the least we want without which improved access to lifesaving drugs means nothing,\" said Shekhawat. 1,443 HIV+ kids in state According to Madhya Pradesh State AIDS control society, there are 1,443 HIV positive children in the state. \"World AIDS Day brings focus on HIV positive children, who are in need of care, support, treatment and protection,\" said UNICEF Madhya Pradesh office chief, Tania Goldner. \"It should be priority to make a difference to the lives of children infected and affected by HIV and also reduce stigma and discrimination, which HIV-affected children still face,\" she added."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Around 3.2 lakh HIV patients in India were on life-saving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in December 2009 \u2014 more than 85,000 patients from the previous year. Be that as it may, 2.6 lakh people are still in dire need of ART. According to the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) latest report, \u201cTowards Universal Access\u201d, which tracks progress in achieving the 2010 target for HIV prevention, treatment and care; around 5.8 lakh HIV patients required ART in end-2009. Globally, the HIV epidemic continued to be a real public health challenge as around 33.4 million people are suffering from the lethal disease. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus. According to the report, only one-third of HIV patients have been put on ART, and coverage of prevention interventions is largely inadequate. This year, WHO\u2019s revised guidelines on ART for adults and adolescents, including would-be mothers, said ART would be initiated when CD4 cell counts reach or drop below 350 cells/mm3, irrespective of whether the patients have clinical symptoms. As per this count, though an estimated 11 -14 lakh HIV patients in India need ART, only 23% are receiving the treatment. The number of pregnant women, who require ART, is pegged at 43,000. But only 21% are covered. Another 30,000-76,000 HIV positive children, too, require ART. However, there has been a spurt in the number of HIV tests across the world. For instance, 100 countries had tested 67 million people last year. In 82 countries \u2014 for which comparable data was available for 2008 and 2009 \u2014 the median number of tests performed per 1,000 people had increased from 41 to 50, respectively. ART coverage, among young adults less than 15 years, has gone up from 22% in 2008 to 28% in 2009. Even the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased from 45% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. In end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving ART in low and middle-income countries, including India, which translates to an increase of over 1.2 million people from the previous year. The report maintains that HIV-related TB remains a cause for concern. In 2008, of the 9.4 million TB cases reported worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million were diagnosed among HIV patients. Though the rate of HIV test and counselling for TB patients is rising, the initiative is insufficient."

        "body": "LOHARDAGA: There has been a rise in the number of HIV positive case in Lohardaga district in recent times. This has come to light with the proper functioning of government's HIV test centre in the district. Although the rise in number of HIV cases is a matter of concern for the common man, the district health department is looking at it in a positive manner. \"This will not only help the HIV positive person to avail better and free treatment but also stop transmission of HIV to others,\" said an official. In last two years the official figure of HIV positive cases was put at 22. Till 2010, eleven persons, including pregnant women and children, were found to be HIV positive in the tests conducted at the government's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) run by State AIDS Control Society. Year-wise detection of HIV positive cases in the district for last three years on an average stands at five. The ICTC was opened in Lohardaga in 2008. Only one one HIV positive case was detected that year. Later detection of HIV positive cases increased. While in 2009 three such cases were detected. The number increased to seven in 2010, five were detected in 2011 and sixes cases have been detected so far in 2012, thereby, taking the total number since 2008 to 22. ICTC counsellor Archna Prasad, however, is not satisfied with the number of detection of HIV positive cases in the district. According to Prasad, many more persons suffer the disease but hesitate to come to the ICTC located at the Lohardaga Sadar Hospital for tests and counseling. \"Since my centre maintains everything one needs, trust is necessary. Although people are coming for HIV tests, we still have miles to go with regard to bringing about awareness among the people and removing reservation of those affected by HIV but keeping away from the ICTC. Migration is the source of the disease and this is a major problem as it is difficult to counsel, conduct tests and offer treatment to the affected persons who live outside the state. At most times we ask relatives to encourage their family members to go for testing at their nearest ICTC where they live,\" Prasad said. The absence of anti retro-viral therapy (ART) centre in the district is creating a problem. A 32-year-old woman found with HIV positive recently has still not started medication as she cannot travel alone. \"She is waiting for her husband, who works in Mumbai, to return. He, too, will have to undergo HIV test,\" a source said."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: In an attempt to increase accessibility of information and treatment of HIV, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) has rolled out a mobile app for AIDS awareness and prevention. The app, first of its kind in India, is based on various international models. The app would provide all kinds of information on AIDS, which is not easily available otherwise. For instance, it will provide information of HIV testing centres in the locality, information on availability of free testing kits and medicines etc. The app, called HELP (HIV Education and Linkage to Prevention), will also prompt users to access HIV testing from the nearest centre free of cost. The idea is to bridge the awareness and accessibility gap through digital intervention and encourage youth to know their HIV status. The move will also help the government to keep a count on the incidence and prevalence of HIV cases, which is currently a major area of contention. The national AIDS control programme is the government's largest health intervention programme. The programme, run under NACO and implemented by states, demonstrated an overall reduction of 57 per cent in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, the facts were questioned by many international agencies, which said a lot of people in India are unaware of their HIV status. According to the United Nations, India has the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world. \"To start with, it will provide some basic information but slowly we will ramp it up to include detailed information and education as well as various services,\" an official said. AIDS Healthcare Foundation, an international agency which works in the area, is working with the government to expand the use of the app across the country. AHF has also funded the app, while NACO is taking care of the operations and implementation part. According to the official, the app will ensure confidentiality and can currently be operated in two languages - English and Hindi. The health ministry is expecting to reach more than 11 crore people across urban and rural geographies through the app. The government is also planning to launch promotional advertisements for the app on television and radio. Besides, it will also use social media and you tube to popularize it. \"Once the app is popular among the youth, we will update it to include more information,\" the official said adding in future it can also be used to spread awareness about many other diseases and preventive healthcare measures. \"There is a gap between the estimated number of people living with HIV and those who have tested and know their status. It is critical that people know their HIV status early so that they can opt for treatment,\" he said."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have discovered that a common drug used to treat nail fungus in feet may permanently eradicate the deadly HIV from the body. The topical anti-fungal drug Ciclopirox causes HIV infected cells to commit suicide by jamming up the cells\u2019 powerhouse \u2014 the mitochondria, researchers said. Unlike current anti-HIV drugs, Ciclopirox completely eradicates infectious HIV from cell cultures, with no rebound of virus when the drug is stopped, according to researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs. However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications. The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged. A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell\u2019s suicide pathway. Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared. And remarkably, the virus did not bounce back when Ciclopirox was removed, researchers said. The utility of Ciclopirox in patients with HIV, for instance after topical application to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, awaits verification in future clinical trials."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Following intervention by the health ministry, many states have withdrawn orders to terminate AIDS/HIV health workers so that activities to stop the spread of the deadly virus are not affected. Both Delhi and Maharashtra state AIDS control society (SACS), which had directed NGOs working with targeted intervention groups to curtail outreach workers by 25% and peer educators by 80%, have put their earlier orders on hold. Gujarat is likely to follow suit soon, official sources said. TOI reported on July 25 that many states had either laid off or stopped paying salaries to health workers involved in national AIDS control programme, posing a fresh challenge to India's largest health intervention initiative already reeling under shortages of condoms and antiretroviral medicines. While states have been blaming lack of funds for the lay-offs, senior officials in the health ministry recently intervened and assured the states of enough funds for the national AIDS control programme, sources said. Health workers, mainly from vulnerable communities like sex workers and transgenders, also met senior officials in the ministry earlier this week. The ministry has also initiated additional procurement of condoms and medicines to meet the shortage, an official said. The move is significant as it was feared that laying off health workers would impact the implementation of the programme on the ground. Besides creating awareness, mobilizing sex workers, transgenders and other vulnerable populations for HIV testing and treatment, these health workers are also involved in distribution of condoms and medicines. However, sources say, the problem still persists in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Almost 6,000 AIDS health workers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have not received salaries for 10 months. India registered a reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, the country still continues to have the third largest number of estimated HIV-infected people in the world. The government is planning to restructure the National AIDS Control Programme, which has been under financial stress, to address the concerns."

        "body": "US researchers have patented a low-cost printer that helps HIV patients living in low-resource settings track the health of their cells. Patients with HIV are encouraged to participate in regular check-ups to keep a track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow cytometers complete the tests by analysing the blood. These, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. With its cost being upwards of USD 50,000, regions with limited resources can hardly afford them. As a solution to this, Thomas Boland, a Professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas has created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells \u2014 cells that are attacked by HIV \u2014 in the body. After drawing a patient\u2019s blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that\u2019s been modified to print out cells instead of ink. Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide. CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it. That number is inserted into an equation that calculates the total number of CD4 cells in the individual\u2019s body. The procedure takes as little as 20 minutes, resulting in ultra-quick results. The printer will help doctors and patients in low-resource settings who do not have access to flow cytometers. The next step in the process is to license the technology to a company that is willing to help get it in the market."

        "body": "Kolhapur: The municipal authority has tied up with the Network of Kolhapur by People Living with HIV (NKP Plus) to provide free medicines and tests to HIV positive patients. The forum comprises of various organisations working for the patients affected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The forum had demanded that the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) should provide the free medicines and perform the required tests without any fees in February at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre set up at the Savitribai Phule General Hospital. According to the civic officials, the ART centre, which was set up in 2013 has since been providing health care to 3,500 patients with HIV. Patients have to undergo various tests before being shifted to the ART treatment regime. The forum, in its letter to the KMC, stated that private hospitals charge anything from Rs 500 to Rs 600 for every test and the total cost of these tests can amount to thousands, which is not affordable for many. HIV is detected through multiple blood tests.V K Suryawanshi, the co-ordinator of ART centre at Savitribai hospital said, \"Once the patient is detected with the presence of HIV, then he or she has to take medicines and undergo regular check-ups life long. We are going to take the help of the forum to get a maximum number patients to ART. The medicines will be provided for free and the pre-ART tests will also done free of any cost. We want poor patients to benefit from the facility.\" \"We have decided to improve the infrastructure for the ART centre. The stock of the medicines has also been increased as we expect a rise in the number of patients,\" added Suryawanshi."

        "body": "NAGPUR: City NGOs working towards AIDS prevention have said that limited funds from the government has hit their daily functioning. They said the money provided is insufficient to effectively run the organizations. The NGOs claimed that they have not received funds for a specific duration from November 2016 to March 2017 and add that none of the officials are looking into the issue. The workers have expressed displeasure over the attitude of the government towards social causes and are worried about their future. The issue concerns numerous city NGOs having a staff of around 400 contractual workers, who run more than 15 projects for Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). These projects are responsible for HIV awareness and prevention and also works for rehabilitation of HIV+ individuals. \u201cThe received money is enough just for the salaries of the workers. Any other extra activity or campaign is not covered in the funds making it very difficult to operate. The allotted sum does not cover miscellaneous expenses, thereby affecting the working,\u201d said Amruta Joshi, joint secretary of Bhartiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh. Anand Chandrani, founder of Sarthi Trust, said, \u201cWorking without salaries for such a long time was already an issue and the limited amount has added to the woes. We are already working day in and day out to reach the needy and fight against the disease, but such acts demotivates the entire cause of working.\u201d Rajabhau Jodh, project director of Manav Vikas Seva Sanstha, said that such fiascos hamper the personal lives of the workers. \u201cA worker also has a family and has to look after his needs. With the salary being received after such a long time and also in such finite amount, the workers feel helpless.\u201d Hemlata Lonave from Indian Red Cross Society said, \u201cThe money received is hardly sufficient for all the requirements of the organization. Moreover, after intimation from the officials to curtail the staff, almost 50% workers were laid off increasing the work significantly.\u201d MSACS joint director Lokesh Gabhane, said, \u201cWe provide them appropriate funds, which are allotted to us by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). We try our best to give appropriate money so that it is sufficient for different activities of the NGOs. Though sometimes the funds might not be on par with their expectations, but it is not the case every time.\u201d Talking about the backlog of salary between November 2016 and March 2017, Gabhane said talks are on with NACO officials and they will try to solve the issues immediately."

Sources said that government hospitals in the district were grappling with a severe shortage of HIV test kits. Alarmed by the situation, collector D Varaprasad took to task district AIDS prevention control unit (DAPCU) authorities for failing to take adequate measures against the crisis. Speaking to TOI, district medical and health officer (DM&HO) Harinath agreed that the situation was dire. He said that a consignment of 170 testing kits had been recently distributed among ART centres and PHCs. He said that the supply hitch was three months old but added that measures were being taken to source more kits. But the worries do not end there. Medical and health officials in the district are alarmed by the sharp drop in the number of HIV/AIDS patients visiting ART centres. Although it is mandatory for HIV-positive patients to visit ART centres for a check-up once every three months, officials said that almost 50% of the patients just stay away from the check-ups. Only 3,000-4,000 of the 12,000 registered HIV-positive patients in the district actually attend check-ups regularly, a senior official said. Siddaiah, who runs an NGO for AIDS patients, said that DAPCU should take the onus to convince patients to undergo check-ups regularly. \u201cSeveral HIV-positive patients choose to avoid the ART centres due to poor awareness and social stigma,\u201d he added."

The social organizations including FXB Suraksha and Positive Women Network of Rajasthan on Wednesday at Press Club appealed to the government that more women coming for institutional deliveries should be screened for HIV through counseling. FXB India programme coordinator (Rajasthan) Suraksha Lata Singh said, \"May 7 is observed as World AIDS Orphan day and the state government is running Treatment & Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centres to save the newborn from HIV transmission during their birth.\" The representatives of the social organizations pointed out that once an infant is born with HIV his life becomes challenging as there have been instances of the child being shifted to shelter homes by his close relatives after his HIV positive parents died. The organizations claimed that the transmission of virus from mother to newborn could be prevented by taking some medication, which minimizes transmission chance. More the HIV testing of pregnant women is done less would be the chances of newborns being infected with the virus. Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) is already conducting HIV tests of pregnant women through counseling. They take the women's consent before conducting the test. The RSACS said they have conducted tests on more than 6 lakh pregnant women for HIV in 2013, which could be nearly 33% of the total pregnant women giving birth to newborns every year, through proper counseling. The auxiliary nurse midwife and general nurse midwife counsel the women to take the test before she gives birth. So far, the new infections among children are 130, the social organizations claimed."

This is for the first time when the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) has been providing relevant information to the newly recruited constables about HIV/AIDS and about their role in preventing the infection from spreading further. A police official involved in providing training to constables said, \"They will undergo a 36-week training. From this year, we have been providing complete information to them on HIV/AIDS during their training period.\" He informed that the training directorate has issued a letter to all the police training schools to hold separate classes for constables on HIV/AIDS. The RSACS trainers hold classes of constables in police training schools in the state and so far they have trained 1,400 new recruits. \"We are sensitizing them and informing them about misconceptions. But, most importantly, we make them learn about the role of the police in mainstreaming the people living with HIV/AIDS,\" a trainer said. Medical, health and family welfare director (AIDS) J P Dhamija said, \"We should prevent new infections of HIV/AIDS. With the same objective, we are spreading awareness among people and police department is one of them.\" He said the personnel are being informed about the groups - migrants, injecting drug users and sex workers - vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infections,. Earlier, the medical department also provided training in batches to police officials but now they have started full-fledged classes in police training schools. Since a lot of migrants come to Rajasthan because of the presence of mines and industries, areas where the migration is high are always on the risk of HIV/AIDS infection. \"Police have to play crucial role in such areas to spread awareness about the infection,\" a department official added."

The member of ward six of Agasaim panchayat while asserting that the petition filed by the secretary of the panchayat body and another member was not maintainable, stated that he had applied for leave on one occasion and had absented himself from another meeting due to a personal problem. The petitioners alleged in a rejoinder that the respondent had manipulated the inward book of the panchayat to record his leave application after the petition, citing his absence during September-October 2012 meetings, had been filed against him. The BDO took note of the leave application. \"This is to inform you that I am unable to attend fortnightly meeting held on October 29, 2012 due to my sickness. I am enclosing copy of Doctor Certificate. So kindly note the same. This for your kind information\" The member did not even request for grant of any leave and appeared to be more of an intimation of absence, BDO, V S Naik Gaunekar noted. The doctor's certificate also appeared to refer to the member's illness in the past tense. \"This is to certify that Cruz Joao Vales from Agasaim was sick and was suffering from viral fever from October 25, 2012.

The certificate was attached to the leave application filed before the meeting! May be, the doctor put the date as October 25, 2012 at the request of the member, he observed.

Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) officials attribute this poor service to shortage of staff. The helpline facility with the toll free number 1800 419 1800, was launched in Chennai in 2009, by the AIDS prevention and control (APAC) in collaboration with TATA business support services under public-private-partnership (PPP). While the centre at Chennai received all the calls, most were not attended to. \"I was very happy when this facility was launched since it allowed me to get answers to my questions without exposing myself. Unfortunately, whenever I called, I never got any response,\" said an HIV patient on condition of anonymity. It was said that the service would be helpful for HIV patients as they would be able to talk freely to the counsellor about their problems, and get advice. The call centre which was functioning in Hyderabad providing counselling to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in four languages, Tamil, Telugu, English and Hindi. Later, it gradually reduced its service and then it was withdrawn altogether, a few months ago. Consequently, TANSACS took over the project and revived the service. But that too failed to make a difference. A TANSACS officer on the condition of anonymity said, \"I'm not sure why the service came to an abrupt stop. It was very helpful for people with HIV to get advice without having to go to doctors. But this service is not possible anymore\". Likewise, the tolls free number functions only between 09 am and 05. 30 pm. \"The toll free number should ideally function round the clock,\" said A Thamil who runs a positive network. When contacted, Leela Krishnan, Joint Director (Information, Education and Services) of TANSACS, Chennai told ToI \"The toll free number is connected to three lines which are serviced by one counsellor. So, the number is found to be engaged most of the times. We have asked the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to recruit additional staff for this service. As of now, we respond to anywhere between 40 and 45 calls per day.\""

        "body": "VARANASI: \u201cHIV does not make people dangerous to know, so you can shake their hands and give them a hug: Heaven knows they need it,\u201d late Princess Diana once said. However, the words seem totally meaningless in the world where people discriminate HIV positive people, even in hospitals. The trouble for HIV infected Ram (name changed), about whom TOI reported a week ago, were seemingly endless. There was discrimination in getting medical aid at Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) divisional hospital. Now, the fate of another HIV patient Vishal (name changed) who, incidentally, has been admitted in the adjacent bed, is also the same. Both these patients lay neglected in ward number 2 of divisional hospital. The lack of awareness about the disease has made the hospital staff reluctant to attend these patients. When TOI reported about the discrimination against Ram in the hospital, the chief medical officer (CMO), Dr MP Chaurasia and district magistrate, Pranjal Yadav and the hospital authorities assured to give proper treatment to him. However, six days later, Ram is still in the similar situation. So is the case with Vishal. Both patients are suffering from severe gangrene infection in their legs and hands and have the history of intravenous drug addiction. Since both are HIV infected. But the paramedical staff of the hospital has refused to attend them. \"They do not even touch me, forget bandaging the wounds. My mother gets the cotton and bandage from the nurses and apply it on my leg, she is uneducated and knows nothing about medicines. I feel helpless. I want to die,'' said Ram, his eyes welling up. According to Vishal, his dressing has not been done from the past one week. He gets his dressing done from a private clinic situated outside the hospital after paying Rs 50 every day. The two cannot go to any other hospital for their treatment because both of them come from very weak economic background. The case of these HIV positive patients has only raised question over the implementation of NACO guidelines that clearly says that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with the general patients. There should be no discrimination, the guideline say. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. In fact the counselors of Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the hospital have also accepted that the hospital staff is not attending the HIV patients properly. The amount of unawareness prevailing in the hospital can be judged from what the para medical staff say. One of them, Saikhu said \"The medical equipments, scissor, knives required for dressing are same for the ward. We cannot use the same equipment to perform dressing on HIV patients. They have separate arrangement at Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). They can go there\". But the hospital authorities do not accept this. \"Giving separate treatment to HIV patients will lead to discrimination. The patients are treated well and their bandage and dressing is done by the hospital staff only\", said superintendent in chief of the hospital, Dr VK Srivastava."

Medicos, too, will be educated regarding recent changes in HIV treatment protocols by WHO as many still are not aware about it, he added. \"The programme also includes creating awareness throughout this week that it is not HIV per se but secondary infections which causes death.

Patients and their immediate families have to travel to Haldwani or Dehradun \u2013 the only places where anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating the disease is conducted. The long commutes are taxing for the infirm. Expressing concern, state health minister S S Negi directed the Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society (USACS) to come up with a plan to allow patients from financially weaker backgrounds easy access to the ART centres. \u201cMost patients below poverty line avoid the trips for they cannot afford the expenses. I hope the scheme will be implemented as soon as possible,\u201d said Negi. A round trip to one of the two ART centres costs anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per person depending on the distance. Reportedly, USACS tried to implement the scheme last year and even sent an estimate for the purpose to the transport corporation. However, the estimated figures were allegedly much higher than needed. \u201cThe estimate quoted an amount in excess of Rs 45 lakhs. Patients travel to ART centres just once in a month or two to collect medicines. In fact, these days there are link ART centres in every district so only a handful will travel to Dehradun or Haldwani,\u201d said an official on condition of anonymity. According to sources, the transport corporation asked the health department to reimburse the amount spent on the free tours \u2013 a proposition the department refuse. \u201cIndeed, the government is providing us the medication. But many of us cannot travel to the ART centres to access the facilities. At times, a patient is too weak to even stand straight, let alone travel to the hospital,\u201d said a patient participating in a rally organized on occasion of World AIDS Day on Monday."

        "body": "MELBOURNE: The elusive quest for an HIV cure received a boost at the world AIDS conference on Tuesday as scientists said they had forced the virus out of a hiding place where it had lurked after being suppressed by drugs. The experiment, carried out with six HIV-infected volunteers, is an important advance in the so-called kick-and-kill approach for a cure, they said. The technique aims to force the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from its last redoubt after it is beaten back by antiretroviral drugs. These drugs can bring HIV in the blood to below detectable levels, enabling sick patients to return almost miraculously to normal life. But the therapy has to be taken every day, is costly and carries potential side effects. If the drugs are stopped, HIV usually rebounds within a few weeks and starts once more to infect other immune cells, exposing the body to opportunistic microbes. For the past three years, scientists have focused on ways to kick HIV out of its bolthole and then kill the hideaway cells. In a presentation at the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark described a step forward in the first stage of this process. Six patients on antiretrovirals took an anti-cancer drug called romidepsin, which prompted virus production in HIV-infected cells to crank up to between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal. In five patients, the level of virus in the blood increased to measurable levels, an important threshold. agencies"

Public health experts say the coming together of the two dreaded infections is worrying. Fourteen XXDR TB cases have been detected in the state so far. State government officials and the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) are tight-lipped about the co-infection case. A source said: \u201cThe patient is yet to be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Such patients are usually treated for TB at the beginning. Once they stabilize, ART is started.\u201d TB is the commonest HIV-related opportunistic infection. An expert summed up the deadly nature of the combined infection saying that when HIV brings down immunity, TB catches up. \u201cThe two need to be dealt with in a synchronized manner. Efforts and the machinery to integrate the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) with the HIV programme need to be strengthened.\u201d As per norm, patients received by registered TB centres are counselled to go for HIV testing and vice versa. Since HIV testing is voluntary, many give it a miss. Doctors say TB patients are often not counselled enough to understand the importance of HIV testing. According to data compiled by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), out of 1.01 lakh registered TB patients, only 40,202, or 39%, were referred to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV testing in 2011 till September. Among them, 1,678 patients tested positive for HIV. In Mumbai, the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is 7-8%. Dr S S Kudalkar of MDACS said mortality among patients suffering from both infections has halved in recent years. \u201cTill a few years ago, the mortality rate (among HIV-TB co-infection patients) was around 8%. Now it is 4%.\u201d He said HIV patients with TB \u201cprobably have a higher risk of recurrence and death\u201d. \u201cAt no point can these patients afford to discontinue their treatments as that could give rise to (drug) resistance.\u201d A chest specialist said HIV clubbed with resistant TB may be tricky, but not impossible to manage. \u201cYes, drug interactions (in such a patient) can have more side effects, but it can be handled if the patient comes in at an early stage.\u201d"

Tamil Nadu recorded 26,089 fresh cases in 2010-11, which reduced to 9,892 in 2013. The sharp decrease in the number of cases follows increased awareness among people about screening and precautions, said experts. \u201cTamil Nadu has a strong health system which focused on meticulous screening for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 2010, around 1.8% of the state\u2019s average population was HIV+.

The state government along with NGOs has reached villages for HIV screening,\u201d said A Bakthavatchalam, deputy director, Association for Rural Mass India, an NGO. The state government and NGOs introduced a number of schemes to reach more people. \u201cOne scheme was to adopt 100 villages and engage into one-to-one conversations with people. Based on the conversations, we would test them for HIV,\u201d said S Kalaiarasi, executive director, Swestic, an NGO that identifies and monitors people with HIV in five districts in Tamil Nadu. Kalairasi said awareness about methods of prevention has increased among risk-prone communities like the transgenders, homosexuals and sex workers. \u201cFive years ago, a sex worker, especially in rural areas, would agree to sex without protection. Today, most sex workers insist on condoms and sometimes even explain the reason to the customer,\u201d she said. Compulsory screening in certain areas has also helped reduce the number of cases. \u201cAn NGO would map a district based on the cases and list high-risk villages. In some cases, based on analysis, NGOs would insist on compulsory screening,\u201d said Bakthvatchalam. \u201cThis was to help people get medical attention if they were in the initial stages.\u201d Experts and NGOs attribute the higher screening rate to funding from and programmes by corporate and private bodies. \u201cOver the years, besides the central and state government efforts, we have seen corporates and private bodies organizing screening camps and awareness, especially in the southern states,\u201d said Raman. While Tamil Nadu is seeing sharp reduction in the number of fresh cases every year, the overall numbers are still high. The state has 80,685 HIV+ people, the fourth highest number in the country."

Highlighting the change in attitude and approach of HIV positive people in the last one decade, he said that while HIV infected people were not ready to even talk about the infection a decade back, now, they have started to open up and look curious to know about the facilities and treatments available. The taboo attached with the infection is slowly diminishing and even the people from rural background are coming forward to share their problems and experiences, added the man, who waged a battle against the lack of awareness and social stigma along with a group of HIV positive people in the region in 2002. The organisation provides care and support services to HIV positive people who come for screening and treatment at the ART centre, BHU. It has also come up with training and community care counselling to sensitise people in the region. How HIV positive people are opening up could be also gauged from the fact that around 700 HIV positive people have already joined the network to spread awareness in the region.

Please help me the way forward. \u200b- By Anonymous\u200b Answer by Dr Deepak Raheja: Your situation is definitely complex and I understand the emotional turmoil within you is furthering it. I strongly recommend that you need to put your emotions on the back burner for a little while and try to get an objective perspective into this situation. Kindly acknowledge the fact that you withheld information from your husband and also chose to have a one night stand for your whimsical temporary gratification. However, it seems quiet evident that you do not do this in a pattern and also you do not have any emotional strings attached to this isolated event and gave in to a weak moment. Secondly, you cannot erase the past. So, its deemed fit that you accept and face the reality and have an honest sit down conversation with yourself evaluating the bond you have with your husband and how he would react to an honest submission by you explaining the situation to him. This will help you deal with your own guilt and you shall be able to face yourself again. One error on your part in no way defines all of you and having the grace and the courage to accept your mistake shall speak volumes about the strength of your character and help you in rebuilding the trust in your relationship.

        "body": "MUMBAI: More than half the HIV-positive children in Maharashtra have lost one of their parents to the disease and a high number have lost both their parents. According to a study done by CHAHA, a care and support programme for children affected with HIV, Maharashtra ranks high in the list of states that have more than two HIV positive members in a family. Between June 2007 and March 2011, CHAHA reached out to a total of 64,056 children and families affected by HIV and AIDS in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Manipur. Out of these, 38% of families were found to be headed by women, many of who had to turn to prostitution to sustain their families. \"There were a total of 21,000 HIV positive children in the ten districts of Maharashtra, 52% of which had lost one of their parents to the disease and 17% had lost both their parents. The numbers were higher than that of the other three states,\" said Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary of Network of Maharashtra for people living with HIV. It was also found that the status of children remains unknown especially after the death of their parents. \"It is only when the child gets an infection and falls ill, that he/she is taken to a hospital and it is there that their HIV status is found out. Because of the delay in detection, most of the time, even the treatment is delayed,\" said Sonal Mehta from HIV/AIDS Alliance India. \"A total of 13,001 children were encouraged to go for HIV tests by the programme, of which about 11% were found to be positive,\" she added. The programme found that the needs of the HIV positive people were different and everything could not be provided by the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. \"For example, those children who were young are now growing up to be adolescents. Their needs are different and they have to be counselled differently from the ten-year-olds\u2019\u201d. In an ART centre, which provides the medicine, this kind of counselling is not available. We go from house to house and work on a personal level,\" said Shabana Patel from the National AIDS programme. The programme, which had been running on global funds, is now struggling to carry on with the work with HIV-affected families. \"The funds were given to us for five years in dollars. But since the value of dollars fell, the funds have got over in three years itself. We have asked for help from the National AIDS Control Program (NACO) and the Central government,\" Patel said."

        "body": "CHENNAI: On July 22, 1987, 33-year-old S Noori sat in a dimly-lit corridor as a lanky woman in a lab coat strode towards her with a medical report. Noori was told she had tested positive for HIV, a then little known virus that was viciously attacking people around her. \u201cShe said I didn\u2019t have much time to live as they had only recently discovered the disease and there was no cure. I was asked to make my life count,\u201d said Noori, a transgender who gave up commercial sex work to help people from her community. The woman who delivered the report to Noori was Dr Suniti Solomon, whose pioneering work in HIV a year earlier had startled the medical fraternity and pushed the government to act. In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India. Noori was among the second batch of around 135 commercial sex workers from Chennai who were tested. \u201cShe didn\u2019t just break down science for us. She taught us to live,\u201d said Noori. For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save and make lives, and lost hers to cancer. She passed away at her residence in Chennai on Tuesday morning. She was 76, and is survived by her son Dr Sunil Solomon. \u201cWe lost a prolific scientist, a great teacher and a wonderful person who worked tirelessly to bring science to the people,\u201d said Dr Sundar Sundararaman, her student and later her colleague. Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College. She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor. While Dr Solomon Victor focused on treating poor patients and in 1989 conceived the Rheumatic Heart Ailment project, Dr Suniti Solomon moved beyond research to set up Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), a premier HIV/AIDS care and support centre, in Chennai. \u201cMore than the virus itself, Dr Solomon was concerned about the stigma HIV positive people faced,\u201d said Dr D Dhanikachalam, head of technical support unit, Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). \u201cWhen the epidemic was first discovered, people were afraid to go close to those with HIV. She felt the pain they went through and worked to fight not just the virus but the discrimination too,\u201d he said. Trained in pathology in the UK and the US, her experience covered a range of aspects linked to HIV infection, biomedical parameters to socio-economics. She also published papers extensively on HIV epidemiology, prevention, care, support and related gender issues. In 2012, Dr Suniti Solomon was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for Service on HIV/AIDS by the state-run Dr MGR Medical University here. In 2009, the ministry of science and technology conferred the \u2018National Women Bio-scientist Award\u2019 on her. In 2001, she was given a similar award for her pioneering work on HIV/AIDS by the state run-medical varsity. A fellow of National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), New Delhi, she had served on several boards, including National Technical Team on Women and AIDS, Advisory Board of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative-India, the Scientific Committee of the National AIDS Research Institute Pune and the Microbicide Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research. \u201cShe was a no nonsense person with a high sense of commitment. Her work is testified through hundreds of publications and her contribution is acknowledged across the world. As a teacher, she taught over 25 batches of students in MMC,\u201d Dr Sundararaman. In an earlier interaction with TOI, Dr Solomon had commended the work Tamil Nadu had done in the field of HIV/AIDS and said the state had come a long way in screening, but the programmes had become complacent with counselling. \u201cWe have contained the infection to an extent among truckers and female sex workers. But if we become complacent there will be an increase of incidence among these as well,\u201d she had said. People who worked with her are not surprised by her prediction. \u201cShe worked tirelessly for the cause not just inside labs but outside as well. If she was concerned, there were obvious reasons,\u201d said a microbiologist, who worked closely with her in the late 90\u2019s. Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the HIV epidemic and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection. \u201cBut what is killing people with AIDS more is the stigma and discrimination,\u201d she had said."

        "body": "MUMBAI: The long-standing demand for a more palatable form of HIV medicine for infants has finally been met with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) rolling out oral pellets in its eight nodal paediatric centres across the country, including Sion hospital in Mumbai. Since little over a month, 16 children aged between six months and two years are being given pellets, which look like homeopathy pills, containing drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The syrup, which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out. The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. \u201cSo far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,\u201d said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. \u201cProblems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,\u201d he added. There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. \u201cHowever, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,\u201d she said. Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. \u201cCurrently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,\u201d said NACO\u2019s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. \u201cGulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,\u201d he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines. A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. \u201cWe only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,\u201d he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country."

        "title": "Aids workers turn matchmakers with good success",
        "body": "NAGPUR: Guidelines from National AIDS Control IOrganization (NACO) say that the officials at the government's counselling centres must provide psycho-social support to all patients. The ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres and the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) in the city are providing this promised support by turning matchmakers for the single, widowed or even separated HIV-affected people. On World Aids Day, it is a laudatory effort. These centres, link the patients desiring marriage to NGOs that take up the task of bringing together like-minded individuals. A list of these individuals is maintained by the concerned NGO along with the qualities and characteristics they would want in their partners. The success ratio of marriages thus resulting is very high, with only two of the 70 matches since seven years going sour. Yet, those who have gone through the grind have had some adjustments to make, from staging a prenuptial family meeting to calling it a love marriage. Another problem is fewer women than men opting to get married. In the beginning making positive people marry to other positive people was among the ways to prevent the infection from spreading, informed Babita Soni, president of NGO Sanjeevan which is doing the matchmaking since 2005. \"With this option provided to them, the patients would not be marrying people without the disease and still be able to enjoy a normal family life. Once a match is made, we give them a premarital counselling, which includes topics like what to do if they wish to have kids,\" she said. Of the 58 marriages that have been made possible through Sanjeevan's Network of Nagpur by People living with HIV, only two have fallen apart. Another NGO actively participating in this matchmaking process is Positive Women's Network. \"It is important that a positive person marries another positive person because the treatment and medication of the disease is a lifelong process, and it also calls for several lifestyle changes. A person with the same problem can provide better support to the patients,\" said Geeta Gondane, the vice president of the NGO. The list of preferences, she said, could include the desired caste, religion and profession of the spouse. Recently, the NGO had a case where a patient's childhood sweetheart wanted to marry him despite the infection. Fortunately, two years after the marriage, not only is the wife still negative but also the newborn child of the couple. However, such a match requires close monitoring of all aspects of life, so that the negative partner does not acquire the infection. \"It has been six years since we got married. As it was an inter-caste marriage, we had to tell acquaintances that it was a love marriage,\" said Praveen (name changed), who was among the first people to get married this way. Another patient said that they had to stage a 'dekhna-dikhana' for the sake of relatives. Prajakta (name changed) said that though some people have discovered their positive status recently, she and her husband have been applauded for not harming a non-infected person."

        "body": "LONDON: In a major breakthrough in the global fight against HIV and Aids, scientists have found that a daily pill taken as a prophylaxis (preventive measure) cuts down chances of getting infected by half among injectable narcotic drug users. Drug users are one of the top three high-risk populations due to sharing of infected needles. The first trial to assess whether preventive treatment with HIV drugs could affect rates of infection in people who inject drugs has found that daily tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir), an anti-retroviral drug, reduced HIV incidence by nearly half (48.9%) compared to a placebo, according to results published in the medical journal The Lancet. A team of researchers led by Kachit Choopanya and Michael Martin, chief of clinical research for Thailand's ministry of public health, recruited over 2,400 participants at 17 drug treatment clinics in Thailand. Around half of the participants were assigned a daily oral dose of tenofovir, while the rest were given a placebo. All trial participants were offered monthly HIV testing and risk-reduction counseling and services, plus access to drug rehabilitation treatment. Participants were followed for an average of four years. Overall, 17 participants in the tenofovir group became infected with HIV, compared to 33 in the placebo group, indicating a reduction in HIV risk by 48.9%. Further analysis showed that the protective effect of the antivirals was highest where participants adhered closely to the prescribed regime, reaching more than 70% in this subgroup. Previous studies have established that pre-exposure prophylaxis effectively reduces sexual transmission of HIV in both heterosexual couples and men who have sex with men, as well as reducing mother to child transmission of HIV."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Now, employment for HIV patients enjoys the prime minister's backing. On Monday, Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh officially called for linking the country's HIV programmes and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme to help HIV patients get employment. In India, social stigma against HIV patients is tremendous, making it hard for the afflicted to get work. Urging ministries to have a \"HIV sensitive\" policy and programmes so that the marginalized populations infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are not denied the benefits of these schemes, Singh, while inaugurating the national convention of zilla parishad and mayors on HIV/AIDS, said, \"We have to ensure that there is no stigma and discrimination towards HIV infected and affected persons. No child should be denied admission in schools and colleges because he or she is afflicted with HIV or because his or her parents are afflicted with this disease.\" He added, \"We must ensure that no person loses his or her employment because of HIV. We must see that there is no social ostracization. We should ensure that women are not doubly stigmatized.\" Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad too stressed on ending stigma against HIV patients. Azad said \"stigma associated with HIV/AIDS is a barrier for accessing services and also pushes the epidemic underground. We are committed to fight this stigma so that people living with HIV can live lives of dignity and get access to education, employment as well as health care without discrimination.\" Azad said the government recently adopted a national policy to ensure a stigma-free environment in workplaces and enhance linkages to services. India is estimated to have nearly 24 lakh HIV patients. Though the adult prevalence is just 0.31%, the nation has the third highest burden of HIV, next to South Africa and Nigeria in terms of the number of people infected. The number of new HIV infections in India has come down to 1.2 lakhs annually as compared to 2.7 lakhs in 2000. \"This means that in the last decade we have brought down the new infections by half,\" the minister added. One area of concern, according to Azad, is the prevention of transmission of HIV infection from infected mother to child. \"Since this is a preventable phenomenon, we have to work towards elimination of this mode of transmission. However, there are major challenges in reaching out to all pregnant women for ensuring institutional deliveries for all the 27 million pregnancies that happen annually,\" he said. He added, \"To meet this challenge, on June 1, 2011, a new initiative called Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) was launched to promote institutional deliveries. Over and above the cash incentives paid for institutional deliveries at government health facilities, this scheme includes free hospitalization, free medicines, free consumables, free diagnostics, free diet (up-to three days in the case of normal delivery and seven days in the case of Caesarean section), free provision of blood and free transport to & fro from home to all pregnant women and their new born.\" The minister exuded confidence that the scheme would encourage women to volunteer for HIV testing."

The toxicology has been done. I am hopeful, the clinical trial will begin by next year,\" Dr Katoch said. He was in city to attend a meeting of the ICMR tribal health research forum at Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in the city. A research team at the National HIV Reference Centre in AIIMS has developed the HIV-1 DNA vaccine. During animal trials in 1996, the vaccine gave immunity to mice and monkeys from HIV sub-type C, which constitute over 95 per cent of HIV infections in India. The vaccine research had faced problems in 2002 as activists staged protest against use of animals in the tests following which trials on monkeys were then shifted to IISc Bangalore. The research had come to a stop after retirement of the developer of the vaccine, Dr Pradeep Seth, from AIIMS earlier this year. Dr Seth had headed the microbiology department of the premier institute. \"ICMR has revived the efforts and all clearance will be hopefully in place by this year,\" he said. Dr Katoch said attempts were made in the country earlier also to develop HIV vaccines. However, two earlier vaccines for HIV were found to have limitations. The one developed by Dr Pradeep Seth in AIIMS is being regarded very promising and may bring paradigm shift in the HIV prevention strategy in future, Dr Katoch said. He said vaccine making is not a priority of ICMR, which is being looked after by the department of biotechnology. However, ICMR is trying its best to facilitate development of certain vaccines such as the one for HIV, which has big relevance for India, he said."

In HIV transmission, where safety is the only prevention, unsafe use of syringes/needles or unconscious prick is making people fall prey to the virus. Accidental or unsafe needle prick in past six years has spread the deadly virus in nearly 1,200 people in Madhya Pradesh. The figure is just an indication how fast the virus is spreading as only few reach to hospitals and are able to confirm the infection source. According to MP State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS), till October 2014, unsafe needle/syringe use has infected 115 people in state, which is expected to rise as year 2014-15 has yet four months to complete. Though there is no steep rise or decline in number of HIV positive patients in the state since 2008, every year over 100 people get infected due to unsafe needle/syringe prick. District Nodal Officer (AIDS), Dr Vijay Chajjlani said, \u201cEvery year people get the virus in their body due to syringes/needles. Many of them do not even know that they have been infected. It comes as a shock for many, when medical investigations diagnose them HIV positive. Few are able to realize whether it was due to needle or blood transfusion when there is no history of unsafe sex.\u201d He suggested health care providers and general population to use fresh syringe/needle each time."

Officials at the Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTC) at Sassoon hospital and Yashwantrao Chavan hospital in Pimpri also confirmed the shortage. \"There are three tests that need to be performed on blood samples to check for antibodies against the HIV antigen. The first test is most important as it picks up positivity of the virus and is extremely sensitive. Kits for this test are in short supply while those for the second and third tests are available,\" said an ICTC official. Most people reporting for voluntary HIV testing have been instructed to come after May 15 but we have not received testing kits till date, said another ICTC official.

        "body": "AGRA: The basic AIDS counselling and diagnostic facilities still continue to be a far cry for the rural population in the district. Not a single community health centre (CHC) or primary health centre (PHC) in the district has AIDS/HIV testing facility or an integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC). Lack of ICTCs is one of the biggest reasons why a majority of HIV patients still go undetected, especially the rural areas. There are a total of 16 CHCs in Agra district and 29 PHCs in the rural areas. Only the CHCs have a counsellors but do not have testing or diagnostic facilities. As a result, people have to come to Agra for treatment. The city has just two places where the facilities are available. Talking to TOI, a health department official said, \u201cIf you check the data of HIV and AIDS patients in the city, you will find that a majority of them hail from rural blocks. They usually come to know that they are HIV+ or suffering AIDS by accident. Those who have minimum awareness about the disease come for treatment while hundreds of others die without knowing what they were suffering from every year. The only reason is that HIV and AIDS counselling and testing is out of their reach.\u201d He pointed out that in Etawah district a large number of HIV and AIDS cases were detected over the past two years because several ICTCs have been opened in rural blocks. He added that though Etawah is a small place with a small population as against Agra and Lucknow, round 50% of its health institutions have ICTC centres there. \u201cThere is no denying that AIDS counselling and testing services are still defunct in many of the identified 24x7 CHCs and PHCs in the city. But if patient shows any of the symptoms like HIV and AIDS, he/she is immediately referred to district hospitals for treatment and tests,\u201d said HS Dhanu, CMO. He said there is a huge shortage of trained manpower at all the CHCs and PHCs, hence getting a separate \u201cThere is a proposed plan to upgrade the CHCs and PHCs. Even the government is planning to rope in a skilled workforce like technicians and counsellors, either permanently or on contract, to streamline the functioning. The project is in the pipeline but God knows when it will happen,\u201d added the CMO."

        "body": "BHOPAL: A slew of non-government organisations (NGOs) working with AIDS patients are likely to go off the list of Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS) for their poor performance. An alarming number of AIDS victims in the state went off the society radar after detection, raising the risk of infecting general population. In January alone, 617 were categorised as lost to follow-up (LFU) - AIDS victims enrolled for counselling and treatment but absconding or untraceable. The NGOs are chaffing over the delay in clearance of their dues by an agency in fairly good financial health. The MPSACS officials are unable to provide exact figure for their dues which sources said runs into lakhs. MPCAS project director Ashwini Rai said, \"Delay in dues payment is normal.\" Rai said, \"Non-performing NGO's would also be penalised financially.\" But with just one of the four NGOs working in Bhopal and similar instances across 34 districts, targeted intervention through NGOs is taking a backseat. The situation is alarming of late. In Bhopal, which rarely had AIDS cases owing to injectable drug use a decadse ago, two dozen new cases are being reported for the past couple of years now. \"The drop-out ratio of IDU's is about 60% and they risk infecting others,\" said sources anti-retroviral therapy (ART).The number of AIDS cases detected in Bhopal for 2011 was 461 according to the figures tabled by the health minister in the state assembly. The MPSACS is considering conducting a pilot project in Bhopal and Gwalior to gather details about AIDS patients through a bio-metrics. \"It is still being planned and the final outcome would be known in about a year,\" said director Ashwini Rai. Even as the MPSACS is trying to find ways to address rudimentary issues, the number of AIDS patients keeps on going up. Currently, the official figure of AIDS patients is 4,755."

The man, a private firm employee who had stopped working after testing positive for HIV a year ago, was married and had two children. He was being treated at the TB hospital near Tambaram and had appeared depressed for the last few days. The depression, police said after talking to his neighbours and friends, was probably due to the stigma attached to the disease. This is a serious problem, say activists working in the field and call for sympathy towards patients. Others say funding for organizations involved in AIDS-related work is dwindling."

        "body": "BERLIN: German researchers are reporting that they may have cured a man of HIV infection, using a mix of high-dose chemotherapy, radiation and stem-cell transplant. If true, that would represent a scientific advance, but not necessarily a treatment advance, said researchers familiar with the work. In the study, published last week online in the journal Blood, researchers at Charite-University Medicine here treated an HIV-infected man who also had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a cancer of the immune system \u2014 by wiping out his own immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and radiation and giving him a stem-cell transplant. Stem cells are immature cells that can mature into blood cells. At the time of the transplant, which occurred in February 2007, the patient, in his 40s stopped taking anti-HIV drugs. Thirteen months later, after a relapse of the leukemia, he underwent a second round of treatment followed by another stemcell transplant from the same donor, CNN reported. The donor\u2019s stem cells contained a rare, inherited gene mutation that made them naturally resistant to infection with HIV, according to the authors, led by Kristina Allers, who hypothesized that HIV would nevertheless rebound over time. But that has not happened, the report said. After three-and-a-half years off of anti-HIV drugs, the patient shows no sign of either leukemia or HIV replication and his immune system has been restored to normal health, the researchers reported, concluding, \u201cour results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient.\u201d But AIDS researchers predicted the report will have little impact on practice. \u201cThis probably is a cure, but it comes at a bit of a price,\u201d said Michael Saag, professor of medicine and director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham AIDS Centre. \u201cFor him to receive the donor cells, his body had to have all of his immune system wiped out\u201d and then receive a bone marrow transplant, Saag noted. The treatment associated with wiping out the immune system \u201cis very hazardous,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somebody doesn\u2019t die from a transplant, there are complications that make it very unpleasant for people to live with,\u201d he said, citing graft-versus-host disease, where the infused donor cells attack the body. Further limiting the treatment\u2019s potential is the fact that it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for each patient, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be applicable unless they develop leukemia or lymphoma and need a bone-marrow transplant,\u201d Saag said."

        "body": "MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday upheld a family court (FC) order rejecting a man's plea to direct his wife to undergo a medical check-up as he strongly suspected her to be HIV positive. The court said it was \"absurd'' for him to say it was in the interest of his wife to go in for early detection. Justice Roshan Dalvi heard a petition by Santa Cruz resident Joel D'Souza (name changed), who met Joan (name changed) through a marriage bureau. Both professionals, they married on December 26, 2009. In June 2010, Joan had typhoid and went to her mother's place nearby. Thereafter, Joel stopped calling or receiving her calls. On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies. On July 10, 2010, on reaching her matrimonial home, she found Joel had changed the lock. On October 22, 2010, he filed for divorce alleging impotency/non-consummation of marriage and cruelty. Pending the petition, on March 16, 2011 Joel filed an application praying for direction to Joan to undergo HIV, TB and hepatitis tests along with tests for impotency/failure to consummate the marriage as he suspected she was HIV positive. In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. \"On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding. He said she applied lip balm five to six times a day \"as the best treatment for Herpes Simplex Virus is keeping the lips moist\". Joan said Joel's suspicion was \"reckless, wild and cruel'' and he himself needed treatment. The FC on May 16, 2012 rejected his application with costs saying, however strong his suspicion, he had to prove the allegations by furnishing evidence so that the court can grant him relief. Joel moved the high court in October 2012. Joan's advocate Mini Mathew argued that the July 7, 2010 report confirming she was cured of typhoid was sufficient to hold that it was not necessary to send her for an HIV test. She said Joel had been spreading rumours about her. \"These allegations are stigmatizing. Her reputation is ruined,'' she said. Joel's advocate Uday Warunjikar said, \"He caught his wife taking HIV medicines. If she is not suffering from HIV, why is she afraid of the test?'' he asked. Justice Dalvi remarked, \"I doubt the marriage can be reconciled. Both sides must move for an amicable settlement.'' She added, \"Why don't you throw her out in a little respectable way? It will boomerang on you.''"

The representatives made the observations on Monday at a two-day meeting here which was attended by members of the department of AIDS control and regional participants working with IDUs. The discussion focussed on strengthening support systems, capacity building, resource sharing and better coordination among regional networks to make harm-reduction services more feasible. \"We are concentrating only on IDUs. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss strategies for strengthening networks and establishing linkages. There is a need to discuss critical areas of diagnostic studies and we need to be engaged with the state AIDS control societies,\" said IHRN's Rajkumar Raju. Despite substantial work in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention in the last two decades, there was still a high probability of new and potential IDUs getting infected with HIV or Hepatitis C in the northeast, said Raju. IDUs are considered a high-risk group, along with commercial sex workers, as far as chances of contracting HIV and other blood-borne diseases were concerned. Harm-reduction services provide substitution programmes for intravenous drug users and provide them with clean syringes \"The infection spreads quickly and most infected persons have no idea that they are afflicted. It is important that we devise ways to strengthen IDU networks in the northeast,\" said Raju. The need for Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) and better OST-related services will also form part of the discussions on Tuesday. \"There should be an effort to make local groups stronger so that information about new populations of intravenous drug users is recorded. Harm-reduction programmes were started to battle HIV,\" said Aditya Singh, department of AIDS control."

On July 14, her husband passed away, reports said. She was allegedly not given admission to the hospital for the next eight days and she continued to sit outside the hospital, the reports said. She was finally admitted on July 22. The social organisations blamed the alleged delay by the hospital in granting admission to the woman for her death. PGIMS Rohtak director Prof Nitya Nand, however, denied that there was any delay in admitting the woman or any callousness shown towards her. \u201cHer husband was brought on July 14 to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre, but the doctors declared him brought dead.

Gays won't reveal their sexuality without fear till the time Supreme Court gives a ruling in their favour. Meanwhile, sex education will go a long way in educating them about safe sex. Parents' support can safeguard them against societal cruelty and mockery, which eggs them on to take the ultimate step. They must not force their kids to get married against their wish.

HC gave the direction while accepting the report filed by standing counsel Pawan Sharma stating that the medical examination of the victim and the three other juveniles, whom he had accused of sexual abuse, found that except the victim no other juvenile is HIV positive. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Indermeet Kaur then asked the counsel to file a fresh status report by March 13, 2013, saying \"an endeavor be made to find out as to the reason why the victim is making allegations against other children and as to who is actually responsible for abuse of the victim.\" HC took notice of the case on the basis of a TOI report highlighting the allegations leveled by the child against three others. The bench had directed the authorities to conduct a medical examination of the victim and the other boys he had accused of sexual abuse. It had also asked the police to verify and investigate. In its report, the police further informed HC that the three boys accused by the child have been shifted to another boys' home as directed by the court. The victim is presently lodged in government's Ashiana Home for Boys in Alipur in Rohini area and had alleged repeated sexual abuse by older boys. According to the TOI report, the victim's mother died of AIDS while his stepfather is lodged in Tihar Jail for raping his daughter, and is also an HIV patient. While the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) decided to keep the child out of the home and place him in the custody of NGO Child Survival India, which reported the matter on February 4, the Committee is reportedly yet to take action against the staff and officials running the institution. In a letter to the CWC, the NGO has mentioned that the child told counsellors that children at the home use to sexually abuse and harass him daily and he did not want to return to the home. The NGO has expressed concern that other children may also be subject to such abuse and has urged the CWC to take further action."

Those tested HIV positive are among 100 thalassaemic children from across the district who have been coming to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly.

A criminal application has come to be filed through advocate Rajesh Dewal, in which it has been contended that following the incident, the parents filed a complaint with local police station. There was a specific demand that the cases should be investigated and the culprits should be booked under sections 308, 328 and 338 of IPC for attempt to culpable homicide and causing injury by administering stupefying drug or poison with intent to cause harm. The lawyer said that police authority was sitting tight over the complaint, and the parents were forced to approach the superintendent of police. But when nothing happened, a petition was filed in the high court seeking directions to police authority to investigate the case after registering an FIR. When this petition came up for hearing before Justice J C Upadhyay, it was pointed out that a PIL was filed by advocate Girish Das, in which similar relief was sought besides demanding compensation of Rs 5 lakh in each of the 23 cases.

        "body": "MYSURU: Nevirapine syrups and tablets, a key preventive medicine for those afflicted with HIV, is now available in Mysuru. Shortage of the medicine had left pregnant women and new mothers living with HIV, troubled. The city got the first batch of medicines on Wednesday afternoon. The state government had issued a notice saying the drug will not be available until the end of October sending HIV positive mothers into a panic. Nevirapine syrup is given to babies born from HIV positive mothers within 72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of contracting the disease from their mothers. The drug which was available at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers was out of stock. It was not available at private organizations as well. After a 20-day delay, the city on Wednesday received its first consignment of Nevirapine syrups. The essential drug was out of stock since the beginning of September. While NGOs were pulling out all stops to get the drug, new mothers and pregnant women were left wringing their hands and worried sick for their babies. People living with HIV were also deprived of combinations of Nevirapine. Speaking to TOI, district AIDS prevention officer Dr Ravi said taking note of the urgency and complaints from NGOs in the city, the state government dispatched Nevirapine syrups for infants. \u201cIt is available at the ART centres and new mothers can avail it. Now there is adequate stock to cater to all pregnant and new mothers with HIV. Newborns are our priority,\u201d he stated. Chandrashekar, head of the city-based NGO Anandajyothi, said that he had written several mails to the authorities and health officers seeking supply of the essential drug. \u201cWhen NACO replied stating a three-month delay in the supply of Nevirapine, we were shocked. The drug is a necessity for newborns and pregnant women. The drug was available at ART centres but not in medical stores in the city. Since 20 days, people with HIV, parents of newborn would visit hospitals and go back crestfallen. New mothers were worried as it was the question of their child\u2019s health. Despite repeated requisitions, the medicine was delayed by 20 days,\u201d he added. According to statistics, the city currently has over a dozen HIV positive pregnant women. Nevirapine syrup is said to reduce the chances of a newborn acquiring the virus from the infected mother. It is given to babies within 24 hours of birth up till 45 days. What is Nevirapine? Nevirapine is a prescription medicine for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and children. It is said to prevent postnatal HIV infection. Nevirapine is always used in combination with other HIV medicines. - (By Akshatha J)"

The centre was proven wrong after the Rims based Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) laboratory which is under the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) tested the patient HIV positive. The glitch prompted Rims management to launch a probe into the episode. \"The incident has been reported. We have sought an explanation from the general manager of the laboratory,\" Rims deputy medical superintendent Dr Kumari Vasundhara said on Thursday evening. Vasundhara said such misleading reports will not be tolerated by the the Rims management. According to reliable sources at the medical college, the middle-aged man from Ranchi arrived for tests at the private lab early this week. The lab, in its report which was furnished on December 8, ruled the suspect negative of HIV contamination. \"However, the doctor attending to the patient was not convinced with the report and asked for a re-test. The ICTC report, which came in late on Wednesday evening, confirmed the patient HIV positive,\" the source said on Thursday. This is the second case at Rims when a HIV patient was heckled at the hospital after a patient was denied admission at the hospital last week. Rims director Dr BL Sherwal had ordered a probe into the incident. Meanwhile, the state health department on Thursday sought suggestions on the upcoming state budget of 2015-16 from its employees. In a meeting chaired by health secretary K Vidyasagar, health department officials were asked to submit their suggestions in terms of new projects based on ground experiences. \"The suggestions will have to be tabled within a fortnight after which they will be deliberated upon,\" joint health secretary Ramesh Kumar Dubey said."

        "body": "JAIPUR: An NGO RNP+ in support of UNICEF and Rajasthan State Aids Control Society has decided to appoint GIPA (Greater Involvement of People living with HIV/AIDS) coordinators and facilitators in 32 districts of the state for strengthening and encouraging quality utilization of health services and social protection schemes for HIV infected and affected households in the state, with special focus on children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHIVs). The RNP+ claimed it was found that only 25% of the needy people living with HIV/AIDS were able to get the facilities with the present infrastructure and manpower. When the GIPA coordinators and facilitators are appointed, it would become possible to reach out to the rural areas. RNP+ president Brijesh Dubey said, \"In five districts, GIPA coordinators would be deployed and at 27 districts GIPA facilitators will be posted. The five districts selected for GIPA coordinators are Ajmer, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Kota and Jaipur. These are the districts which are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS in the state.\" The duration of the project will be nine months starting from April 2012, which would conclude in December 2012. Besides, GIPA coordinators and facilitators there would be at least 15 Women Living with HIVs (WLHIVs) in each of the 32 districts who will be trained to form self help groups. This will further strengthen the existing positive mothers association (PMA) in Rajasthan and provide supplementary manpower for district level networks to streamline and maximize effective service delivery efforts for the betterment of CLHIVs and their families collectively and sustainably. RNP+ state in-charge, projects, John Samuel said, \"The project will help in establishing effective links between various service delivery points and proper support to beneficiaries for availing facilities of all components including: (i) nutritional support through Integrated Child Development Scheme; (ii) Free diagnosis, medicine and treatment for all ailments including ARVs (Antiretroviral), (iii) Promote and ensure institutional delivery for pregnant women from initial stage of ANC services to Janani Shishu Suraksha Yojana, (iv) Awareness generation on available vocational training centres (v) Provision for financial support like pension, insurance or social security; (vi) Priority in other schemes available for women and people living below poverty line (e.g., Anthodaya, free housing, access to land, etc.) and (vii) Free legal aid in case of any disputes.\" He said that the project will be focused on WLHIVs and CLHIVs as the coordinators and facilitators would be only women. It will also groom WLHIV as responsible care givers with increased knowledge and best practices to support themselves and their families. This will help reduce stigma-related practices, make services more inclusive, support the existing government mechanism to perform well. The RNP+ claimed that the project is mainly focusing on optimum use of the knowledge and skills of already trained care givers in HIV infected and affected households to further carry out effective outreach activities for the benefit of CLHIV (Children Living with HIV AIDS) in particular and WLHIV and families in general."

        "body": "KANPUR: AIDS counselling and diagnostic facilities continue to be a far cry for the rural population. In, Kanpur, AIDS counselling and testing facilities literally do not exist in any of the CHCs and PHCs, except Bidhnoo CHC. This is the main reason why majority of AIDS patients go unidentified. There was an action plan proposed by the Central government in 2009, under which each state had been given a target to upgrade about 50% of the CHCs and PHCs under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) by March 2011. Under this upgradation, the community and primary health centres were to be upgraded as per the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) in order to provide an optimal level of quality health care to the rural population. The HIV testing and AIDS counselling was also in the list of upgradation. But the scenario of the city is enough to show the success of the plan. Talking to TOI, a health department official informed that in the absence of ICTC centres in rural areas, city or even the country will not be able to fulfil the theme of World AIDS Day-2012, which is to get \u2018Zero AIDS and HIV cases, zero discrimination and zero deaths due to HIV\u2019. \u201cIf you cross-check the data of HIV and AIDS patients in the city, majority of them are hailing from rural blocks. It was just due to some accident, they get to know that they are suffering from AIDS. Those who are a bit aware come for treatment while hundreds die every year. The only reason that HIV and AIDS counselling and testing is out of their reach,\u201d the official added. The official also gave the example of Etawah, where a large number of HIV and AIDS cases came into light in past two years. The reason is an increase in number of ICTC centres in the rural blocks. Etawah is a small place with very less population in comparison to that of Kanpur and Lucknow but around 50% of its health institutions are having ICTC centers. \"There is no denying that AIDS counselling and testing services are still defunct in many CHCs and PHCs in the city. Similar is the scene statewide. But if patient shows any of the symptoms like HIV and AIDS, the immediately referred to district hospitals for treatment and tests,\u201d informed Dr GS Bajpai, District Tuberculosis Officer. \u201cThere is a plan to upgrade the CHCs and PHCs. The government is planning to rope in a skilled workforce like technicians and counsellors, either permanently or on contract, to streamline the functioning. The project is in pipeline,\u201d DTO added."

        "title": "ART drugs shortage bane for HIV +ve people in NE",
        "body": "Guwahati: About 63,049 HIV infected people in the northeast are facing acute shortage and depletion of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs. The slack supply could lead to there being no stocks left which could make HIV positive people very vulnerable to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drug resistance as well, according to activists working with HIV positive people. The region has the highest number of HIV positive people and intravenous drug users in the country. According to the department of AIDS control (2013-2014) and as per NACO HIV estimates, the total number of new infected adults was 6,460 and there were 3,594 AIDS related deaths in the northeast region. Organizations working with HIV positive people said that depleting stocks in medicines such as Nevirapine, combined dosages of Tenofovor and Lamivudine, and Abacavir have rendered a section of the adult HIV positive people in some places to use medicines meant for children who are HIV positive. In Manipur, which is considered to have the highest number of HIV positive people in the country (40,855 in March 2012), Nevirapine is almost out of stock, sources said. A 200 mg dose of Nevirapine is taken twice a day by a HIV positive person. With diminishing stocks, patients were reported to be taking Nevirapine 50 mg four times in the morning and four times in the evening. \u201cWe cannot live without these drugs. The situation has been going on for a while. We are dependent on these medicines and a timely duration during the present course of the drug regimen keeps our health in check. Authorities should take necessary steps,\u201d said Rajkumar Kanta, president of Community Network for Empowerment (CONE). Besides the shortage, slow dispatch in medicines on the part of courier services has also caused problems. An emergency dispatch of Nevirapine for Manipur took 28 days to reach the destination. The dispatch was lying idle for 19 days in Guwahati, sources said. \u201cI took a tracking slip from one courier company for tracking Nevirapine. It revealed that from Hyderabad to Guwahati, it took 28 days. It also showed that the stocks were lying idle in Guwahati for 19 days. This is ridiculous and totally unacceptable. Among the numerous bottlenecks, this courier service is one major hurdle,\u201d said Loon Gangte of International Treatment Preparedness and Coalition. In Dimapur district of Nagaland, the Nevirapine paediatric drug is out of stock at ART centres. The same drug is available in Mokokching district but its availability could diminish in two to three weeks. In Mizoram, Nevarapine syrup, which is given to newborns, was also reported to be out of stock. In Assam, activists said there is a shortage of Nevirapine syrup and Tenofovir and Lamivudine fixed dose combination."

        "title": "Should an HIV test before marriage be made compulsory?",
        "body": "Even as the state government actively considers the move, we delve into the issue Madhu\u2019s (name changed) life has just come crashing down. The 23-year-old, married for the past one-and-a-half years, has tested positive for HIV and she knows she has contracted it from her husband. Her family is distraught but there\u2019s little they can do. \u201cNow, we realise the importance of getting an HIV test done before marriage,\u201d says her father. Madhu\u2019s is not the only case. Many such instances across the country are highlighting an urgent need to make HIV test mandatory before marriage. The State Women and Child Development department is actively considering the move. In fact, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister, Women and Child Development, recently said that her department had sought opinions in this regard from UNICEF and NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients. But to bring about this rule, amendments to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts, will be needed. And even though it looks like the need of the hour, it\u2019s not that simple. In the past, such a move has encountered a number of hindrances. Why some people are opposing the move: Some argue that making this test mandatory infringes upon a person\u2019s right to privacy, which is a fundamental human right. Also, a big concern is that post-tests, an infected person may be ostracised in his/her community. A generalised policy like this could adversely affect HIV control programme itself, as fear of social discrimination could force people to flee rather than come forward to declare their HIV status. That apart, there are people opposing it because of the veracity of HIV tests. A wrong diagnosis could cause havoc in a person's life. Besides, there is something called a window period during which a person may test negative despite being infected. Says gynaecologist Dr Firuza Parekh, \"The HIV test is not fool-proof. At the time of testing, a person may come negative but turn positive six months later due to the window period. That apart, there's also the question of who will bear the cost of the test. So, what are we trying to prove through these tests? Is it just promiscuity because in that case, a person could even cheat by getting somebody else's test result.\" Sexologist and marriage counsellor Dr Shirish Malde, agrees. \"People might resort to getting fake test reports. Also, asking for this test can give rise to certain trust issues,\" he says. But the fact is that there are many cases where a person has contracted the virus from his/her partner and often it comes to fore when the woman is pregnant, he says. \"And the person who was already infected at the time of marriage tends to pretend or actually may not even have been aware. So making such a test mandatory before marriage may help,\" This test is as important as kundlis: In Mumbai, a large section of people, especially youngsters, are of the opinion that the test must be made mandatory. \"People are worried to ask a potential groom in particular for a test, lest it upsets him and his family. But, it's as important as checking the kundlis in current times,\" says 26-year-old Tina Raina, a computer professional. A thought echoed by may others. Dr I S Gilada, President of AIDS Society of India, who has been working in this field for almost three decades, emphasises, \"This step may upset some people in our traditional society who might even call of a marriage. It's mainly young unsuspecting women who suffer in this. Human rights activists may say that declaring HIV status of one person to the other is violation of his/ her privacy. But doesn\u2019t the potential spouse have a right to be protected from the disease? One\u2019s right to privacy cannot infringe upon another\u2019s right to life. In fact if it is made mandatory, there will be more awareness and more people going in for regular checkups.\" What's the solution: Instead of just an HIV test, a couple about to get married could undergo a comprehensive health check-up that includes tests for diabetes, thalassemia, haemophilia and other sexually transmitted diseases. \"This way we can ensure better medical compatibility between partners. And even if a partner tests positive for HIV, he/she can be rejected only as 'medically unfit' and won't have to carry the stigma of an HIV/AIDS patient. Vice-verse, if they decide to go ahead with the marriage, it is with fullest knowledge and understanding, so they can\u2019t blame anyone,\" says Gilada. States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Goa in the past attempted to bring about such a rule, but could not succeed. Will Maharashtra manage to do it? Let's see... Raima Sen, actress: If such a bill is being considered, I\u2019m glad it is because we definitely need this, especially in areas where education levels are low. Many suffer because of not having knowledge and rather than that suffering, it\u2019s better you are aware of things beforehand. Siddharth Dhanvant Shangvi, author: There\u2019s no clear-cut answer. In principle it seems logical enough: both partners should make an informed decision. But by legalising the process, not only do you bring the state into the bedroom, you also stigmatise HIV further. After all, there are many conditions that must be ascertained before we enter a partnership. Why aren\u2019t those investigated? Nandana Sen, actress: Making the test mandatory could intensify the inhuman stigmatisation that HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients grapple with. Brides and grooms must be encouraged to take the test before marriage, but it should be voluntary. Rakhi Sawant, TV actress: I totally agree with the government and feel everybody must go for a check-up every six months. Nowadays, people are indulging in all kinds of vices. Today, a wife doesn\u2019t know if her husband has been in a relationship with another man or woman! Anushka Manchanda, singer: In our country, where there is still a very prevalent arranged marriage system, a mandatory HIV test would be a boon. Due to our conservative society, these questions are barely asked. Mugdha Godse, actress: Alarming statistics show how children suffer because of their parents being HIV positive and women who not find out if their husbands are HIV positive suffer. It\u2019s thus best to be aware. Sahil Shroff, actor and model: Everyone should get an AIDS test; the government should organise this free of cost and have an awareness campaign on sex education. What is more of a concern, is how we treat those who are AIDS victims. Mukul Dev, actor: I totally support this move to have an HIV test before marriage; especially when one is beginning a family. It will also be a step towards removing the taboo attached with AIDS. Hansika, actress: I agree with the move. Some families may not like it because they are traditional. I feel the issue is personal."

Police suspect she might have been suffering from depression since her mother died of AIDS five months ago and committed suicide. They are waiting for the post-mortem report to rule out foul play. The girl has been living at the Be hala address for the past few years. It was her mother who had decided to return to her parents' home with her son and daughter after her husband deserted them when he was detected with AIDS. The girl's mother had died in January . The family suspects the father, too, may have died by now. The girl's grandmother said her son-in-law had never contacted the family after walking out a few years ago. It was the girl's 11-year-old brother who first spotted her body hanging from the ceiling. It was he who cut the rope and brought her down. Their maternal uncle then rushed to Vidyasagar S G Hospital with the body , where doctors declared her dead. Neighbours said both the girl and the boy studied at local schools in Be hala. They lived in the house alongwith the grandmother, a maternal uncle and a pet dog. The family had been living in the two-room tolly-roofed house -a stark misfit in the middle-class neighbourhood of Senhati Bazaar in Behala for the past several years. \u201cThe young boy was visibly shaken after he brought down the lifeless body of his sister. He has not been speaking to anyone. To make matters worse, cops called him and his elderly grandmother to the police station and recorded their statements for several hours on Thursday . They looked physically and emotionally drained when they came back home on Thursday night,\u201c said a neighbour, unwilling to be named. TOI attempted to speak to both the boy and the grandmother, but they refused to speak. \u201cWe don't want to say anything. I just wish no one has to go through the kind of suffering me and my grandson are going through. We are tired and don't have anything to share,\u201c the grandmother told TOI on Thursday evening. According to the uncle, the girl was undergoing treatment and aware of her disease. Locals said she had tried to escape a couple of years ago, but the attempt was foiled after a neighbour spotted her."

Researchers studied those aged 15 and above and the infections were divided into categories like bacterial, viral, others and infection type such as sepsis, hepatitis, genital, central nervous system, HIV or AIDS. There were about 8,09,384 (11.2%) individuals hospitalised with infection during follow-up. Among them, 32,683 suicide cases came up, and of those 7,892 (24.1%) individuals had been previously diagnosed with infection during hospitalisation. Study results suggest hospitalisation with infection was linked to a 42% higher risk of suicide death compared to those individuals without infection.

        "body": "MADURAI: The Madurai Network of Positive People\u2019s Society is trying to get a girl child, who was adopted by an HIV positive woman, enrolled in school, as the woman was unaware of the consequences when she decided to bring up this orphan as her own, four years ago. Speaking to TOI, B V Babu, president of the society said that the woman Jaya (name changed) (40) had enrolled in the society in 2009 a few weeks after she tested positive for HIV. \u201cShe is one of those lucky ones where the virus had been dormant for over 15 years,\u201d said Babu, who himself had tested positive 13 years after being infected. The woman had told the society members that her husband left her 20 years ago after infecting her with the disease. The couple had a daughter, who was married off last year. However, the woman, who was employed as a sweeper in a private nursing home in Vadipatti near Madurai, hid her HIV condition from her daughter\u2019s in-laws. In the meantime, the woman applied for the Rs 1000 assistance given by the government to women who had been abandoned by their husbands. She had sought Babu\u2019s help for obtaining the same. After filing up her application, he asked her to meet him in his office. \u201cWhen she came on Tuesday, I was surprised to see her being accompanied by the four-year-old child,\u201d he said. When Babu inquired with the woman who the girl was, she told him that it was her daughter. \u201cImmediately, I questioned her how she could have such a daughter of that age when her husband had left her 20 years ago. I even asked her angrily if she had an affair,\u201d he said. That was when the woman broke down and narrated the story of the girl. She told him that the child was abandoned by her biological mother in the hospital where she worked and the authorities entrusted her with the duty of putting the child in the cradle baby scheme. \u201cI did not have the heart to abandon the child and decided to bring her up as my own as she would be of support to me,\u201d she said. Babu said that he found the woman\u2019s claims to be genuine and explained to her that what she had done in her ignorance was a grave mistake. She was told that the child would have to pursue a good education to become self-sustained in future. \u201cMy only fear is that I will lose this daughter if I have to educate her with the help of officials,\u201d Jaya told TOI. Madurai district social welfare officer M Jayalakshmi told TOI that the woman was not justified in bringing up the child illegally. The child would immediately be handed over to the child welfare committee in Muthupatti and if there are no claimants, then the girl would be produced in court and her foster mother would have to make a claim from there. \u201cIf the court deems her unfit to bring up the child, she would come under our care and we will take care of its proper adoption,\u201d she said. Enrolling the child in school is not an immediate possibility according to her."

        "title": "36% jump in HIV among Mumbai gays in 2 yrs: Study",
        "body": "MUMBAI: A notable increase in the prevalence of HIV among men having sex with men (MSM) in the recently concluded HIV Sentinel Surveillance in the city has alarmed anti-HIV crusaders. The annual surveillance carried out by the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has pegged the prevalence at 12.5% in 2010-11 (April-March ) compared to 9.2% recorded in 2008-09 , an almost 36% jump from the base figure. Though commonly MSM population is equated with gay men, activists debate that it is not so, as bisexuals\u2014men having sex with both men and women-\u2014too come under the gambit. HIV prevalence among MSM in the city had seen a huge fall from 23.9% to 6% between 2000-2001 and 2005-06 . But, after that, the graph has only zoomed upwards with the prevalence going up to 7.6% in 2006-07 , to 8.6% in 2007-08 and 9.2% in 2008-09 . There was no surveillance for the year 2009-10 . Project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) Dr S S Kudalkar did not want to comment on the issue. Project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) Dr S S Kudalkar did not want to comment on the rise in prevalence of HIV among men having sex with men in the city and said he was yet to receive the detailed figures of the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS). NACO officials , too, remained unavailable for comment. While, the state agencies have reached out to only 39,572 MSM, NGOs accept that the number is \"grossly underreported\" . \"It is a complicated area where even gay organizations have limitations as far as reaching out is concerned. Here, we are talking about men, many of whom do not want to be identified as gay,\" said public health expert Dr Shilpa Merchant, previously associated with Population Services International. Activists are unanimous that there are many men who regularly indulge in sexual activity with other men but resist being labelled as gay fearing social stigma. Gay activist and chairperson of Humsafar Trust Ashok Row Kavi said that the government had managed to reach out to only networks of identified homosexuals. \"Bisexuals do not even want to come to identifiable places. This population is incredibly difficult to access ,\" he said, adding that the number of MSM population could be \"very, very high\" . Medically, the debate has often revolved around anal sex being riskier than vaginal sex, and therefore, spouses being vulnerable of getting infected not only with HIV but other sexually transmitted diseases. But Kavi said that it would be impractical to say that only gay men indulged in such sex. \"Studies have shown that up to 45% of heterosexual married couples indulge in it, though that too is a high-risk behaviour . The idea is to educate men about safe sex,\" he said. Kavi also said that in the course of reaching out to gay men, his NGO had observed that between 50% and 55% of men were having sex with their wives as well as other men. \"Of these, around 25% were married and did not seem to be under any pressure to indulge in such sexual behaviour,\" he said. \"Internet holds the key to reach out to MSM. We have to reach them through emails, tracking sex sites and then educate them,\" said Kavi. The internet has emerged as the most commonly used medium by men to look for \u2018partners' . Merchant said the government should think of ways to reach out to all men rather than only gay men. \"There are hardly any dedicated programmes to target this high-risk population . We need neutral organizations to participate,\" she said."

        "body": "PANAJI: Until recently, 16-year-old Rihan Gauns (name changed) was often bullied by some of his classmate. A class XI student, Rihan is HIV positive, an infection he got from his parents who are now long dead. His is a two-pronged struggle. On the one hand, while he fights the infection in his body, on the other he has to battle social ostracism. Gauns is one among the 253 children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, for whom life is a daily struggle. As they cope up with their life-threatening ailment, they battle virtually everyday with society, which looks on them with suspicion. President of Human Touch, Peter Borges informed that one or both parents of most of these children are dead. Some live with their extended family or with a single parent while some are being raised in orphanage. The HIV status, whether that of a child or an adult, is not revealed, but sometimes it does come out exposing them to discrimination, Borges said. \u201cWe managed to stop bullying in Rihan\u2019s case after we approached the school management, but it was a difficult situation nonetheless,\u201d said Peter who added that society should be more accepting of such children, and disease itself. Some of the 253 children living with HIV are in their teens. There are a few who are above 18 years of age, too. Though the government provides a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 to persons living with HIV, Borges said not all are able to avail of the allowance due to bureaucratic hassles. There are five youngsters under his guidance for whom he has arranged a room to stay as they have no family members to rely on. To provide care and support, Goa State NGO forum on HIV/AIDs, comprising of eight NGOs, has analysed the main obstacles facing HIV+ children and charted an action agenda to overcome the same. The biggest challenge before those who are above 18 years of age is what to do next. Some though are completing their education. The NGOs want the government to intervene and help this segment of the society that has been left behind."

Customers have stopped coming to Shekhar's tea stall, wife Sangeeta lost her job as an assistant cook in the local school and their three sons are being shunned by classmates and teachers. All because government officials didn't maintain confidentiality about the family's HIV status in the central government's Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme. In this scheme, HIV families get foodgrains at subsidized rates from the food & civil supplies department. After officials revealed their medical condition to villagers about three months ago, the family of Shekhar has been ostracized. \"It all began when the sanction letter of the AAY card reached the gram panchayat. Two days later, GP members met with school development managing committee members and the headmaster told me not to come to work from the next day,\" Sangeeta told STOI. Shekhar said, \"We were happy despite our problem. We've known about our disease for about one-and-a-half years but never told anyone about it. After that letter, my sons were not even allowed to drink water from the school tap.\" Shekhar asked the authorities why their personal details were disclosed. The couple even considered committing suicide, but timely intervention of NGOs gave them hope. A senior officer of the food and civil supplies department said, \"It's possible the tahsildar inadvertently sent the sanction letters to the gram panchayat. We'll look into the issue,\" he added. Raghavendra T, deputy director, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust, said, \"It's a clear violation of human rights. Nobody can breach confidentiality, particularly in such cases.\" Deputy commissioner Ekroop Kaur said, \"It's a serious issue and I'll issue a directive to all offices to avoid such mistakes. I'll also try to ensure Sangeeta gets her job back, if she wants it.\""

        "body": "PATNA: Three antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in Bihar will carry out viral load testing for HIV/AIDS from April 19. It is under the \u2018Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)\u2019 initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year. The ART centres selected in Bihar are at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur. Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year. The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. \u201cA hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,\u201d he said. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient\u2019s blood. \u201cIn more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,\u201d a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said. There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test."

Maharashtra, which comes next to Andhra Pradesh in HIV -AIDS prevalence -- accounting for 18 per cent of the afflicted population in India -- has launched a multi-pronged drive to curb the menace, initiating various steps under the National Aids Control programme, said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS). \"The high prevalence districts in Maharashtra besides Mumbai, include Sangli, Latur, Pune, Satara and Kolhapur. Efforts are on to curb transmission of the infection from high risk groups (HRGs), which consist of sex workers, truckers migrant labourers and drug users, to the common population,\" he told PTI. Deshmukh said HIV positive people are now coming out of the closet to register themselves with government agencies and NGOs to avail the ART, which is being provided free of cost at various government and civil hospitals throughout the state. The widespread network of the affected people was proving to be effective in fighting the stigma attached to their status in society, he said. \"Another challenge the health officials are facing is of ending discrimination in rural schools against children with HIV positive status. The health directorate has launched a drive to sensitise health care providers, workers, NGOs operating at village level. Parents and teachers are being involved in this exercise.\""

Records in possession with TOI show that fake bills were forwarded to Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) by officials of District Aids Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), Ranga Reddy, every three months, since the mobile van was parked at the Eicher showroom in Gaganpahad for repairs. The bills amount to nearly Rs 4 to Rs 5 lakh. A city NGO, Asara, had even brought this to the notice of Ranga Reddy district collectorate during a Prajavani grievance redressal programme recently but to no avail. The four personnel who were assigned to the mobile van have not been paid salaries for months. \"I had lodged a complaint with project director of APSACS, complaining that I have not been paid salaries despite the fact I used to travel in city buses every day to contact high risk population after our ICTC van broke down. But with no response forthcoming, I quit my job in December 2014,\" said HIV counsellor Sanjeevulu, adding that the lab technician appointed along with him too left the job. Both Sanjeevulu and lab technician Raju quit as they salaries for nine months running into more than Rs one lakh remained unpaid. G Aswartha Reddy, the showroom manager of Eicher where the ICTC mobile van was parked for more than one year, told TOI: \"We forced the district authorities to take away the mobile ICTC van few days ago as they were unwilling to get it repaired.\" When contacted, B Kishore, project director, APSACS, said that he was not in a position to comment as he was now caught up in MLC poll duties in AP. It is significant to note that city is leading Telangana state in terms of detection of HIV positive cases (both Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy combined reported 5966 and 2456 new cases respectively between April, 2013 and December, 2014). When it comes to undivided AP, the situation is worse as the state reported the second highest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the country in both 2012 and 2013 standing at 1,29,410 and 1,61,978 people respectively after Maharashtra. Times View At a time when the government is trying to bring down HIV/AIDS cases, such fraudulent means to pocket funds is a shame. Efforts must be made to check whether similar scams are occurring in other districts as well and the guilty brought to justice."

While growing need for spreading awareness among high risk groups like commercial sex workers and migrant populations was highlighted during the one-day visit of director general (DG) of NACO, Aradhana Jauhari, to various ART centres in the city on Tuesday, the changing dynamics of HV/AIDS in east UP and Bihar regions of the country also attracted attention on the occasion. \"Awareness holds the key for curbing the menace of HIV in eastern UP region and parts of Bihar that have now become the high priority areas for National AIDS Control Organisation NACO,\" said Jauhari while talking to TOI after visiting the ART centre at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Tuesday. Saying that the invisible killer has continued to spread its tentacles in the Hindi speaking states like UP, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan, she stressed that the selected pockets of east UP and Bihar with high migrant population remain high risk zones in the country. Apart from Varanasi, Jaunpur and Ghazipur, other pockets like Azamgarh-Bhiwandi-Mau and Patna-Muzaffarpur in Bihar have a good number of migrating people who are infecting their family members and local population with the HIV virus. There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said. It may be mentioned here that the DG of NACO visited ART centres of BHU, SPG Divisional Hospital and DDU Hospital besides holding a meeting of UP NACO officials and other senior district health officials in the day. Stressing the fact that prevention is the only cure in this case, the DG said that eastern UP and Bihar states could learn from the experiences of Tamil Nadu and other southern states that have shown reversal in the trend with receding cases in the last few years. Similarly, advocating for establishment of more ART centres in east UP and Bihar, she also maintained that counselling, support and care services offered through ART centres including integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) and voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTC) need to play pro-active role in spreading awareness. The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection has reduced to 50% in the last one decade, but still the figure is high particularly in the Hindi speaking states. A prevalence rate of 0.3% is far from satisfactory and much work is yet to be done to bring it further down, she added."

From February 2013, pregnant women tested positive for HIV will be given a combination of three antiretroviral drugs recommended by WHO for pregnant women with HIV/AIDS. \u201cThis will reduce the transmission rate to less than 1%,\u201d said AIDS control society project director Kumar Jayanth. TN, where the virus was first detected in the country in 1986, has led the fight agai- nst HIV/AIDS. Tamil Nadu once had one of largest number of HIV/AIDS cases in the country, but it has brought down incidence of infections to 0.3%, becoming a role model for other states in the country. The incidence of HIV is on the decline across India, but the state is working towards achieving the WHO international goal: \u201cGetting to zero: zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths.\u201d \u201cThis cannot be possible unless we stop transmission from mother to child and make treatment accessible to pregnant women,\u201d Jayanth said. Women now get one dose of the antiretroviral therapy during labour. This prevents the mother passing on the virus to the baby. The baby gets a dose of the drug within 72 hours of delivery. However, studies by various institutions, including National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, have found that 10% of babies of women with HIV/AIDS contract the virus even with this treatment. The research centre, the central testing HIV laboratory for newborns in TN, Pondicherry and Kerala, receives at least 1,200 samples every year. Of these at least 120 test positive for HIV. Experts point out that the testing process is flawed. \u201cThe lab first gets a drop of dry blood on a filter paper. If this tests positive, we repeat the test on fresh samples. But it takes an average of six months to it,\u201d said NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan. While tracking cases, Dr Swaminathan found that less than 25% of the children who tested positive for HIV had started treatment. \u201cThe other children were dead or could not be found,\u201d she said. The statistics are similar at the department of genetics in TN Dr MGR Medical University, which is the testing centre for Andhra Pradesh, says Dr S Mini Jacob, head of the varsity\u2019s department of experimental medicine. \u201cIt is proved that starting treatment for a pregnant women will stop transmission to the child,\u201d Dr Jacob said."

The woman stated in her application that her marriage was solemnised with the man, a resident of Kalamboli in Raigad district, on May 20, 2013, in Uttar Pradesh. While the couple was residing in Ahmedabad, the woman became pregnant following which her blood test was done in which it was revealed that she was HIV positive. Following the disclosure, the husband sent the woman to her parents' house and they bore the expenses of her delivery and medical treatment. The woman, now residing at her parents house since she is unable to maintain herself and her child, sought interim relief, including Rs 37,000 maintenance per month. After hearing both the parties, Thane Judicial Magistrate had earlier ordered the husband to pay Rs 6,000 per month as maintenance to his wife. However, the woman's husband and his parents challenged the magistrate's order which was recently upheld by the court of District Judge P P Jadhav. Judge Jadhav observed that the applicant (woman) is residing with her parents because of refusal by opponents (husband and his family) to allow her to co-habit with them. At this stage, it cannot be ascertained as to how the applicant got infected with HIV. \"The fact that she was diagnosed HIV+ve after the marriage is itself sufficient to conclude that she got infected while continuation of her marital relationship with the opponent,\" the court observed. \"Under such circumstances, being husband it was the boundant duty of the opponent to look after her and maintain her properly,\" the Judge said. Though the opponents have not denied responsibility to maintain the child, no evidence is produced on record to show that the opponent is spending any amount for the same. Under such circumstances, the applicant being wife and having a child from opponent is entitled to be maintained by him, the court ruled while concluding that the order passed by the magistrate is proper, correct and legal.

Body piercing has come a long way, from earlobes and nose in the past to eyebrows, belly button, lips and tongues now. But it needs care in the initial days to avoid infections. Most of the youngsters go for piercing at a parlour or from an untrained person which makes the situation worse, said Dr SK Arora, skin specialist at Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital. He pointed out that lack of hygiene and improper sterilisation of the gun used for piercing are the common reasons which cause infection. There are some people whose skin is sensitive, when they clean the pierced area with antiseptic lotion, they get eczema. ENT expert Dr Neeta Bhura said that piercing the earlobes and eyebrows result in common complications, nose or naval infections can be fatal. Nose infection could result in swelling and pain for a few days at the pierced site. Also, studs and rings can get caught in clothes, which can aggravate the problem. \"There are times when a stud gets entangled in clothes and pulls the skin, leaving one in extreme pain. So this unexpected rubbing can lead to further complications,\" she added. Experts also suggest that one should avoid going to random piercing shops and opt for experienced hands to avoid infection. \"A lot of ENT surgeons and plastic surgeons also do piercing, it is safer to get it done from them, as they understand the body system better. And more then that, one should know the Dos/Dont's to get a healthy and beautiful body,\" said she added. Side effects of piercing are: Nerve damage: If the piercing is not done properly then there are chances of nerve damage near the pieced areas. Contamination: There are chances of infection or virus through dirty needles. Be cautious, check if the piercer is using sterilised needles and equipment Allergies: These are major side effects of piercing. If your skin is sensitive you may get allergies or irritation. Pain: If a person can't bear pain then it is advisable that she/he should not go for tongue and nipple piercing. Keloids: is another side effect that you can notice after piercing. These are a type of scars."

        "body": "TRICHY: It is usually doctors who advise patients to take precautionary measures to avoid health complications. But doctors themselves have to be more cautious about contracting contagious diseases from patients they treat. Of late, both doctors and nurses in Trichy hospitals are alert to HIV risks from patients undergoing surgery. There have been cases where HIV-positive women who were admitted for delivery or caesarean didn't disclose their health condition fearing discrimination. To be on the safer side, doctors are now insisting on HIV tests for all surgery cases. Sources said two HIV-positive pregnant women got admitted at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for emergency delivery in October and December last year. Only after completing the surgery, doctors came to know that they were HIV-infected. \"A nurse fainted after knowing that the blood scattered on her during the delivery was of an HIV-infected woman. She later took treatment to avoid the infection. Such incidences have occurred occasionally,\" said a hospital source. R Selvakumar, district supervisor, District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), said the HIV tests are being compulsorily done after such incidents. \"Following such incidents, HIV test was made mandatory. But we have heard that some private hospitals don't conduct the HIV test though it is a simple procedure. Doctors should take precautionary measures and HIV patients should not hide their health condition. Moreover, HIV-infected people should screen themselves at anti-retroviral therapy centres,\" said Selvakumar. Some private doctors here said patients hide information about certain health issues fearing adverse response. Dr S Nagamani, an obstetrics and gynaecologist here, said most private hospitals are strictly following all procedures before carrying out any surgery on pregnant women. \"Patients may not disclose condition fearing discrimination. But we take universal precaution to avoid any infection from any patient. The risk of infection is higher from Hepatitis B-affected patients than HIV-infected ones. Still, we do the HIV test before carrying out any treatment and safely handle the waste blood,\" said Dr Nagamani. Some doctors say that they can only advise the patients to undergo HIV test but they cannot force them. \"Yes, there is risk for doctors. But we educate them to undergo necessary tests. Our patients too agree to undergo tests. But we should not force them because they have the right to refuse to undergo tests,\" Dr A Charmila, a functionary of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India. Dr KS Devanathan, the president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Trichy, said HIV test is mandatory for all patients. \"As patients are not willing to disclose their health problems before undergoing surgery, tests are compulsorily done at all private hospitals so that doctors can be safe,\" said Dr Devanathan."

        "title": "State AIDS counsellor caught for trying to sell free HIV test kits",
        "body": "MUMBAI: In an incident that has shocked the agencies fighting HIV/AIDS in the state, the facilitators themselves were caught indulging in malpractice and trying to make a fast buck by selling HIV testing kits that are supposed to be given free of cost to counselling centres. A corrupt counseller was arrested last week and both he and a lab technician, also involved in the alleged racket, have been dismissed from their job. The incident came to light when Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) officials in Mumbai were informed that outreach workers of an NGO in Kolhapur were trying to sell HIV testing kits. The rapid testing kits, which can reveal an individual's HIV status in less than 30 minutes, is provided to the MSACS by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for free. The MSACS later distributes the kits to its 578 integrated centre for counselling and testing (ICTC) centres across the state. On getting the information, the MSACS officials decided to nab the culprits. Once the investigation started, the officials found that one of their own counsellors, Raghunath Kamble, and lab technician Hemlata Patil were the masterminds and the NGO workers were mere mediators. Additional project director Dr Dilip Deshmukh, who helped nab the culprits with the help of MSACS officials from Kolhapur, told TOI that the incident was shocking and something that the agency had never witnessed. \"The culprit has been handed over to the police and a case has been registered. We are now checking if such a racket exists in other parts of the state,\" he said. District superviser of Kolhapur Niranjan Deshpande was the first one to learn about the racket. Subsequently, on finding that Naagsen Kamble, an outreach worker from Lotus Medical Foundation, was trying to sell the testing kits to private labs, Deshmukh sent some officials as decoy customers. These officials contacted Naagsen, who on September 19 called them to say the deal would be sealed in a hotel at Jaysinghpur, a small town in Kolhapur. \"As our officials, posing as customers, reached the hotel, they found that it was one of our counsellors, Raghunath, who was trying to sell the kits,\" said Deshmukh, adding that he offered Rs 5,000 for two kits, which can conduct up to 100 tests. Deshmukh then contacted the police who arrested Raghunath. During his interrogation, the counsellor told the police that lab technician Hemlata also had some testing kits at her home. \"Hemlata's house was searched and around 30 kits were recovered from her refrigerator,\" added Deshmukh. He said both Raghunath and Hemlata had been dismissed from MSACS. \"We have asked other agencies to be extra cautious,\" he added. A Mumbai District Aids Control Society official said following the latest \"bust-up\", they have given out stricter orders on the already stringent protocols about the distribution and use of the kits to curb any such incident in future."

The NGOs are now facing difficulties in arranging community meetings of patients as the staff does not have funds to provide them food or medicines.\"Our NGO is taking care of around 2,100 HIV positive patients under three different projects. We have not received a penny since April. The conditions were bad since the past 18 months, but have become worse now. We are facing troubles paying salaries to our staff. The staff members are the only point of contact for HIV positive patients. If we lose the staff, it clearly means we have lost contact with the patient,\" said Shivaji Dhone, programme manager of Muslim Samaj Prabodhan Shikshan Santha, one of the prominent NGOs working in the HIV sector.An official of another NGO Sakhi Sanghtana, which primarily communicates and sensitises female sex workers in Kolhapur and Ichalkaranji where HIV prevalence has been a concern for the past two decades, said the programmes for HIV patients have been severely affected because of lack of funds.\"The treatment process is getting affected as we do not have funds to procure medicines. We have received information from other NGOs in the state where the condition is similar or worse. Some of the NGO staff, who were living in the city on rent, have gone back to their native places. They can no longer afford to pay the rent. Under such circumstances, the entire aids control measures would come under threat,\" he said, requesting anonymity.Sources in MSACS said there is dearth of funding for the project from National Aids Control Organization (NACO). \"Funds for aids prevention project largely come from international agencies, which has declined in the past three years. It has affected budgeting of the programme across the country. The funding has almost halved,\" sources added.The dearth of funding in Kolhapur was reflected on Tuesday when collector Saini praised the district-level aids prevention and control unit for continuing the work despite lack of money. Last year, Saini had made successful efforts to get Rs 25.88 lakh approved from the district planning and development council for the aids control unit.Admitting to shortage of funds, Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of the Kolhapur unit, said her office is trying to ensure atleast basic medicines and condoms for the patients using the funds received till March this year. \"However, we are not able to assist the NGOs, which are our prime source of reaching out to such HIV patients,\" she said.Key risk groups in state."

The court, however, acquitted his girlfriend and mother for lack of adequate evidence. In her complaint filed in 2012, the woman, a resident of Sirsa in Haryana, had accused her husband Sunil Kumar of Telupura village in Abohar subdivision of administering her HIV-infected saline two years ago. She said Sunil wanted to eliminate her and marry his paramour Gurvir Kaur from Moga. She had married Sunil in March 2006 before he went to study laboratory technician course in Bathinda, where he fell in love with his classmate Gurvir. She asked him to divorce his wife when she learned that he was already married. However, his wife, who had been blessed with a baby girl by then, refused divorce. Sunil and Gurvir then hatched a plot to eliminate her. They stole a sample of HIV-infected blood from a laboratory and he injected it while administering saline to his unwell wife. The complainant said she had noticed that the saline was red in colour and pointed it out to her husband, but he told her it was laced with some anti-biotic drugs. Her condition deteriorated and Sunil did not take her to a doctor. Her father took her to a private hospital in Sirsa, where her blood samples were taken for clinical tests. The doctors diagnosed her as HIV infected and referred her to PGI, Chandigarh, for treatment. She lost her vision during the course of treatment. She lodged a complaint after she was referred to PGI. On the basis of a probe by the doctors, a case was registered against Sunil and his paramour. Not satisfied with the quantum of punishment, her father said the accused deserved capital punishment. \"We will appeal in the high court to enhance the punishment and also challenge the acquittal of the other two accused in the case,\" he said."

Haryana has already established one Anti-Retrovial Treatment Centre at PGIMS, Rohtak, and 16 Link Anti-Retrovial Treatment Centres in the districts for treatment of HIV and AIDS patients free of charge. Dr Vijay Kumar, in charge of district AIDS control department, said, \"The link ART centre will be opened in Delhi within two-three months. Doctors have already been trained for this purpose and HIV positive patients will be given medicines from here.\" On the eve of World AIDS Day, Haryana Chief Minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the theme of World AIDS Day was \"Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-related deaths\" and the state government was committed to provide better treatment facilities to people living with HIV and AIDS and to keep a check on deaths caused by it. This year, 200 patients have been registered with the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in Gurgaon. The first centre was opened at the Civil Hospital in 2002 in the district and at present there are six such centres in the district. In 2002, eight patients were registered, but gradually the number has increased over the years. Kumar said the main reason for this is awareness among people. Haryana health minister, Rao Narender Singh, said that to reduce the prevalence of HIV among drug injection users of Haryana, three new Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres and seven new targeted intervention (TI) projects would be started in the state. Singh said that three new Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres in Panipat, Faridabad and Bahadurgarh would be opened under the Harm Reduction Programme. Singh added that there was a downward trend in the number of HIV and AIDS patients among different categories in the state. The prevalence of HIV in pregnant women has decreased to 0.14% in 2012 as against 0.30% in 2006. Similarly, this percentage in general clients had fallen down to 1.64% as against 6.47% in 2006. The prevalence among female sex workers had also shown a decline from 1.19% to 0.58% whereas among injecting drug users it had reduced from 2% in 2008 to 1.01% in 2012."

Details are yet to be worked out, said an official source. This was decided at Ganjam district AIDS prevention and control committee meeting held at Chhatrapur on Saturday. Besides activists, working in the field of AIDS, officials of Odisha State AIDS Control Society attended the meeting. \"The arrangement will reduce the ever-increasing HIV positive cases in the district. At present, they constitute around 38% of total HIV cases in the state,\" collector (Ganjam) Krishan Kumar told TOI. As many as 10,948 people (38%) tested HIV positive in the district by June. AIDS has so far killed 968 people in the district, official sources said. The meeting also decided to register names of migrant workers in their respective panchayats so that the administration can track them. Anganwadi workers will collect migrant workers' data, which will be complied at the panchayat office,\" said a senior officer. Integrated health camps would also be held for HIV-positive persons in each of the 16 identified blocks every three months. The camps would screen people for other diseases as well apart from facilitating select medical investigations.

The Foundation had set up four hospitals across South India two years ago, to curb the spread of HIV in the region. They were established at Bagalkot (Karnataka), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Tiruchi (Kerala) and Kakinada (Tamil Nadu). The US-based Global Foundation For AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had given financial support for the treatment of patients suffering from these three major diseases. A Chennai-based voluntary organization, Population of India, took help from the Foundation to set up these hospitals, which came as a boon to HIV-infected persons. The Bagalkot hospital, which started out in a rented house in Godi, on Muchakhandi Road, served patients from North Karnataka. The hospital had a 50-bed capacity. More than 4,157 HIV-affected people have been treated in this hospital till today, but fatalities have been a mere 400. The main reason for the hospital shutting down is that GFATM announced that it would discontinue funding. The agreement contract was not renewed from March 31, 2010. The closure procedure began on March 15, with patients being shifted to the government hospital. Equipment worth Rs 30 lakh was returned to the parent organization. It has also affected 32 staff working here, but it is patients who are worst hit. While the government is thinking of opening a separate section in the district hospital, it remains to be seen if these patients can be served round-the-clock and as efficiently. Several NGOs, social workers and industrialists approached the elected representatives to keep the hospital going, but till today, there has been no response from the authorities. Bagalkot district has a high number of HIV-positive patients, and with the closure of the hospital, the ball is now in the government's court."

This was revealed from figures available with the Thane district AIDS control programme department. According to records, between December 2007 and October 2014, 23,542 people were detected with HIV, of which 2,178 died. Around 18,557 tested positive were registered for medication, while treatment of 14,000 has already begun. The tests were done after counseling the people at the 40 integrated counseling and treatment centers in the district. Though, the area-wise classification for the last seven years was not available, health officials said most of the cases could be from Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar, going by the block-wise AIDS testing reports for 2013 and 2014. Officials said the positive thing was that more people have started visiting the healthcare centres on their own to get themselves tested. Compared to 86,009 people who got themselves tested in 2010, the numbers shot up to 1,29,046 in 2013, while the first 10 months of 2014 saw 1,59,326 people coming forward for tests. Going by the test reports, officials said there was a dip in the number of people being detected with HIV in the last five years. While 4,570 (5.31%) were tested positive in 2010, the numbers dipped to 3,171 (2.45%) in 2013, while in 2014, till now 2,761 (1.73%) have been tested positive. Activists said there was a need for heightened awareness drives in the district. \u201cThe disease was discovered in the 80s and even after 40 years if so many people are still afflicted, then it poses a question on the efforts taken by the health department,\u201d said activist Nitin Deshpande.

And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. \u201cWe are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,\u201d said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village. It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital. \u201cI have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,\u201d said Vidya. But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. \u201cI did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for the rest of the days,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,\u201d she added. When Sangeeta\u2019s husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta\u2019s family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed. But, when Rekha, who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms. But not all had it easy. When another resident Rani Devi insisted that her husband underwent a test, he retorted: \u201cTum humko bataogi ki kya karna hai (Will you tell me what I should do?).\u201d ASHA worker Karuna Devi said threat of importing HIV infection from Mumbai still looms over the hamlet. Village head Dharam Raj revealed that at least 250 residents from 200 families worked in Mumbai and came back home only on festivals. \u201cNo one knows what these men do when they are far away, living alone. We counsel youth and men when they leave Fatehpur for work. The stand taken by the women of the village is laudable,\u201d said village pradhan Dharam Raj. Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. \u201cInstead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,\u201d said Ramesh Kumar, who has been working in Mumbai since 1999. Social organisations working in HIV prevention in the village are also helping empower women. President of Nehru Yuva Sangathan, Rajendra Sahu said: \u201cWomen are better change-makers than anyone else. An aware woman force in the village has checked the rate of new cases in the past few years.\u201d STATS 357 cases of HIV reported in Fatehpur in 2005-15. Of these 48 cases were reported last year In Udaisarai village, 52 HIV reactive cases came to fore in a health camp held in 2005 As many as 44 persons, including five families, have died in this period As on date, 12 patients of HIV are undergoing treatment Risk of TB looms large over most patients here Read this story in Hindi: \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0905\u0921\u093c\u0940\u0902, HIV \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093f\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0928\u094b \u090f\u0902\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940"

        "body": "VISAKHAPATNAM: The AP AID's Control Programme is now focussing on prevention of vertical transmission of HIV infection from pregnant women to newborns by introducing a triple-drug regimen as against the single drug treatment with Nevirapine. The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent. As per AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average. Project director of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, \"We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent.\" Recently, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. \"There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,\" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS. Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, \"Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,\" he stated. AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women). Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006. ANC prevalence dropped down to less than 1% (0.77%) for the first time in 2010, as per the latest survey."

The patient, a resident of Rajnandgaon, the home constituency of chief minister Raman Singh, who reportedly needs dialysis, has been denied treatment by state run premier institute Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital as well. This is in contravention of apex court's orders and the HIV AIDS Bill 2007 that prohibits discrimination of an HIV/AIDS patient in several matters, including healthcare. According to sources, the youth was recently diagnosed with HIV at a private hospital in Raipur. Since his condition was deteriorating, he was advised to undergo dialysis. Sources said with no hospital willing to undertake his treatment, the youth has gone back to his hometown. According to Dr Puneet Gupta, a nephrologist at Ambedkar hospital, the youth was initially undergoing treatment for some ailments at a private hospital. \"Once the doctors there learnt about his condition, they washed their hands off and advised him to move to other hospitals or a government run institute,\" said Dr Gupta.Dr Gupta admitted that the patient had approached dialysis unit but the same was denied. \"If a dialysis machine is used on a patient suffering from HIV, it not only affects the other machine due to same pipes interconnected but needs sterilisation too, which isn't a very simple procedure\", explained Dr Gupta. He said there are presently 60 patients admitted in the% hospital and 35 of them are on dialysis. \"We cannot use the machines on HIV patients at the cost of treatment to other patients\", he said while attempting to justify the hospital's decision."

        "body": "RAIPUR: When Rupali married Abhinav (both names changed) a few years ago, she was dreaming, just like any other girl of her age, of a happy married life and having children. However, her world literally fell apart when after few months of marriage, her husband tested positive for HIV. Her fears of having been infected by her husband proved incorrect when she tested negative. Many thoughts, including deserting Abhinav, crossed her mind then but she was truly in love with him. In her own words the \"thought of letting a virus ruin her married life was just not correct\". Though she decided to stay with Abhinav, her dreams of having children were shattered as unprotected sex with her husband could not only put her at risk of contracting the disease but could also infect the child that she desperately wanted. The couple had given up all hopes till someone told them that it might be possible for them to have their child through the assisted in-vitro fertilization (IVF) reproduction technique. After consultations with city-based doctors the couple went ahead with IVF and is now expecting their first child in another two months. \"We are praying that the child is free from HIV\", they say. While they may have some doubts, the doctors who carried out the procedure on them are however confident that the child would be \"normal and healthy\". However, they refused to disclose the name of nursing home as such patients object on it. Dr Neeraj Pahalajani, a leading city-based practitioner, said that world over, more than 400 cases have been documented where couples, with HIV positive husbands, have successfully had children through IVF/IUI technique. \"We have also used the same technique on several couples and are sure that their child too would be healthy\", she says. Elaborating, Dr Pahalajani said, however in IVF- ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) technique, the husband's semen, which carries the infection, is washed thoroughly using specific medical solutions and one single sperm is picked to fertilize the egg. The embryo is subsequently transferred into the mother's womb. But it is not 100% risk free. So they can also adopt other procedure of donor's sperm. Dr Pahalajani says with acceptance about HIV growing in the society, it is the responsibility of the medical fraternity to offer solutions to the HIV-infected couples to raise healthy families."

This was pointed out by advocate Vikash Kumar Pankaj before a division bench of Justice Navin Sinha and Justice Vikash Jain on Monday while the bench was hearing a PIL filed by one Sanjit Singh on the alleged insensitive attitude of different bodies of the state and Union governments towards the dreaded disease. Pankaj, who is the counsel for the petitioner, pointed out the ambiguity in the records of the state government, saying the Bihar State AIDS Control Society's report suggests there are around 39,000 people in the state with HIV. This number is far less than the number given by the state government. The large gap in the two reports shows they are hardly concerned about the exact number of such persons let alone providing them proper medical facilities, he argued. Despite the contradictions in the two reports, it can't be ignored that the number of people with HIV was increasing every year, argued Kumar and submitted before the court newspaper reports regarding death of three HIV affected persons at Patna Medical College Hospital. These reports included a TOI report on the death of a woman at the hospital due to alleged lack of sensitivity on the part of hospital authorities. The PIL has been filed by a person with HIV. The matter will again be heard on Thursday."

Most of the affected inmates are undertrials, the jail administration sources said. The cases were discovered during regular health camps held at the jail over the past several months.

Mishra, however, couldn\u2019t elaborate on the reason for the infection. \u201cIt is very difficult for us to know the source of infection. We can only say that they have been found HIV-positive during checkups.\u201d According to prison department officials, 1,400 inmates of Gorakhpur jail have already been screened and 400 more are being examined. \u2018We hold health camps for awareness\u2019 IG (prisons) Pramod Kumar Mishra said an exercise to identify such patients was on across all UP prisons and a report on the findings would be forwarded to the state government. \u201cWe organise health camps for better awareness among these patients,\u201d he said. Last month, Unnao\u2019s Bangarmau tehsil hit the headlines when 58 residents of three villages tested HIV-positive at health camps organised locally in November and January. It was alleged that the infection had been caused by a quack who reportedly used infected syringes. The development triggered the health department into action while NACO and UPSACS officials rushed to the affected localities for awareness camps."

The pregnant woman, who hails from a village under Gola block of Ramgarh district, gave birth to a child after a 14-hour ordeal. While she was in labour, one of the nurses assisting her was mistakenly pricked by the needle meant for the woman. Sources in the hospital said none of the medical staff was aware that the patients was HIV+ till her mother-in-law asked the nurses to administer her an injection meant for HIV positive mothers. This came as a shock to the medical staff and the nurse who was hurt by the needle used in the HIV positive woman. The nurse was immediately referred to Rims to run necessary medical tests on her. Confirming the news, Dr Ashok Ram, medical officer in charge of the government hospital, said the mother-in-law of the pregnant woman told him that her son is HIV positive so it's likely that her daughter-in-law may have got the infection too. However, he added, \"We can't confirm if the nurse is infected as the test reports are pending.\" Doctors at the government hospital suspect that the newborn too is HIV positive.

However, prior to that, the journey wasn't easy for this girl suffering from thalassemia, a condition caused by variant or missing genes that affect the production of haemoglobin in the body. She had to undergo regular blood transfusions to fight the genetic disorder. Finally, it was a website by Bangalore-based startup Jagriti Innovations that came to her rescue. The company, in association with Cure2Children Foundation, Italy, has developed a software platform for complete management of bone marrow transplant. Noor not only underwent such a transplant in Islamabad but also got financial concessions, thanks to some generous doctors in the network. The site, , provides technical support to thalassemia care, and has tied up with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Centers in low and middle income countries like India, Pakistan and Italy. The software enables storage and tracking of policies and procedures, apart from drugs/supplies inventory management warning of low stocks and expiry dates. \"The website helps doctors have a real-time conversation along with patient's medical records with their counterparts from other centres. There are 12,000 children born with thalassemia each year in India, and the only curative option available to them is bone marrow transplant (BMT). Our technology makes BMT safer and more affordable,\" says Rajat Kumar Agarwal, CEO, Jagriti Innovations. Recently, the startup's work was featured in the Journal of American Medical Informatics Association. However, hospitals in Bangalore are yet to tap the technology. \"Only one hospital in Bangalore deals with a large number of thalassemia patients and it's a government one. We have approached authorities and are working towards a tie-up. In the next three months, five children suffering from thalassemia from Bangalore will be taken to Jaipur for bone marrow transplant,\" adds Rajat. Since 2008, over 2,400 patients have been registered, more than 1,600 have been tested for histocompatibility, and 112 bone marrow transplantations have been performed on children with thalassemia. In Bangalore alone there are 800 kids suffering from thalassemia at any given time. In most cases, the disorder can be cured with donation of matched, healthy stem cells from the patient's sibling. \"The focus is on a medically, ethically and financially justified advanced medical procedure,\" says Dr Lawrence Faulkner, medical director of Cure2Children Foundation."

People should be cautious about being involved in freak road accidents than worrying about being infected by just playing or sitting with an HIV positive child,\" stated Falleiro, who is an associate professor, vice-principal and head of the department of economics, Rosary College of Commerce & Arts, Navelim. It is to be noted that many of the findings from his PhD thesis were published in internationally and nationally reputed journals. Falleiro credited the Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) and other NGOs for doing their bit for HIV infected persons and also creating awareness in the state; which he believes has lead to a declining rate of HIV positive cases detected in recent times in Goa. He added that though they have done their bit, there is still much to be done for the infected and affected, considering the serious nature of fallouts that they have to face in their day-to-day lives. The book is an outcome of an intensive study conducted in the state and is bound to give the reader new insights of the multi-dimensional economic hardships faced by HIV/AIDS households. \"The medical expenses of HIV positives respondents (one per household) was on an average greater than the total medical expenses of all household members taken together from non-HIV/AIDS households, despite free treatment received by majority of those suffering from HIV/AIDS,\" said Falleiro. Falleiro also highlighted the plight of minors by stating that about 10% of the households withdrew their children from school, forcing them to take up odd jobs or turn care-givers to help sustain the family. \"Almost 55% of the HIV/AIDS households required care-givers and around 10% of the care-givers were minors,\" revealed Fallerio, adding that 75% of the HIV/AIDS households have made no provision for their children's future."

The prevalence of the virus among sex workers in brothels is higher than street-based and home-based sex workers, according to an RSCACS report. Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society's (RSACS) state report released recently shows that one out of 71 street-based sex workers and one out of 208 home-based sex workers are living with HIV. \"HIV prevalence varied depending upon type of sex work. Higher prevalence of 3.25% has been found among brothel-based sex workers followed by 1.4% among street-based and 0.48% in home-based sex workers,\" according to the report. The report elaborates that HIV prevalence varies among female sex workers (FSW) on the time they had spent in the work. \"Considering the duration of sex work, highest positivity has been recorded among those who are in the profession of sex work for around 3 to 5 years. During the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2008, the highest positivity of 6.25% was seen among new entrants (i.e. six months to one year of sex work). In HSS 2010-11, among new entrants, the HIV prevalence is only 1.67% which is reduced by 5.58% as compared to HSS 2008,\" the report says. The HIV positivity among sex workers with one to six years in the profession is 1.67%, among those with one to 3 years is 0.38%, those with 3-5 years have highest prevalence of 2.39% and with more than 5 years in profession, such workers have 1.36% of prevalence. RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence among sex workers have declined over the past few years. \"Result of the HSS 2010-11 shows that the overall HIV prevalence amongst female sex workers is 1.28%, a significant decrease of 2.53% from 2008. Three consistent sites Ajmer, Alwar and Banswara showed significant decrease in prevalence,\" the report says. The result of HSS 2010-11 shows that highest HIV prevalence rates among FSWs have been recorded in eastern and southern parts of the state. \"Nearly one out of 20 female sex workers are living with HIV in Alwar, while Udaipur and Ajmer have almost one out 100 sex workers with HIV, Ganganagar has one out of 200 sex workers with HIV,\" the report says. Alwar has higher prevalence as the work is brothel based. An RSACS official said the prevalence among the sex workers is on the decline because they are more aware of precautions and also the officials are conducting individual tracking to prevent HIV infections among FSWs. While comparing prevalence between rural and urban areas, it has been found in HSS 2010 data that prevalence rate is higher in rural areas (1.95%) as compared to urban areas (0.57%). \"A scrutiny of higher vulnerability to HIV rendering to the characteristics of the population marks that women who have certain education are more informed, and thus better able to protect themselves from HIV. This was observed in HSS 2010 data where educated female sex workers comprised a lower proportion (1.01%) of the total number of HIV positive than their illiterate counterparts,\" the report says. Moreover, the positivity is on the decline among young female sex workers aged 20-29 years. It was 4.24% in 2008 compared to 1.78% in 2010-2011, a decline of 2.46%."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: A Tihar Jail's woman prisoner, facing trial in cases of cheating and forgery, has accused the jail warden of torturing her with the help of HIV positive woman inmate for extorting money from her. In a plea to a Delhi court, Honey Sharma, lodged in Jail 6 of Tihar Jail, has also apprehended that she might contract AIDS. Lodged in jail for over three months now and facing trial in 11 cases, Sharma, in her plea to chief metropolitan magistrate Vinod Yadav, alleged that she is being tortured by the head warden and warden for money. Sharma's two-year-old daughter also lives with her in the jail. She told the court that the wardens \"beat her up badly and got the AIDS patient to scratch her with their nails.\" She alleged that the she was beaten up for an hour before the deputy superintendent and the jail staff who remained mute spectators. She also alleged that her daughter was also manhandled by the warden and her pleas for being taken to the hospital were dismissed. Sharma, along with her husband Vipin Sharma and five other persons -- Sachin Sharma, Harshad Alam, Bhupender, Aman Alam -- are accused of cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and also under the Passport Act for running a racket of providing fake passports and visas in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. Barring Honey Sharma, all were arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police after an FIR was lodged in 2009. Honey Sharma was declared a proclaimed offender and could be arrested only in January 2012. They are involved in over 30 such cases and were also slapped with charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for running an organised crime syndicate. They were, however, discharged from MCOCA by a sessions court. She pleaded to the court that she should not be sent back to jail as she fears being tortured and should instead be allowed to visit a doctor at her own expense for she fears contracting AIDS. The court has called for comments from the jail authorities in this respect."

In the same period, 8,049 were registered on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and 3,583 patients were alive on ART.Blood transfusions in Assam are fraught with risks. In June 2013, five persons received HIV-positive blood in Mangaldai Civil Hospital in Darrang district. On Monday, a three-and-a-half-year-old child undergoing treatment for burn injuries at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) received HIV-positive blood.\"This system will prevent liars and dubious professional blood donors from donating. It will also enable taking stock of existing blood supplies,\" said health expert NK Beria.There are three regional blood transfusion centres one each in GMCH, Assam Medical College Hospital and Silchar Medical College Hospital.According to a 2015 'fact sheet' of Assam State AIDS Control Society, the blood bank at GMCH is considered to be a 'state-of-the-art model blood bank'."

The patient, a resident of Rajnandgaon, the home constituency of chief minister Raman Singh, who reportedly needs dialysis, has been denied treatment by state run premier institute Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital as well. This is in contravention of apex court's orders and the HIV AIDS Bill 2007 that prohibits discrimination of a HIV/AIDS patient in several matters, including healthcare. According to sources, the youth was recently diagnosed with HIV at a private hospital in Raipur. Since his condition was deteriorating, he was advised to undergo dialysis. Sources said with no hospital willing to undertake his treatment, the youth has gone back to his hometown. According to Dr Puneet Gupta, a nephrologist at Ambedkar hospital, the youth was initially undergoing treatment for some ailments at a private hospital. \"Once the doctors there learnt about his condition, they washed their hands off and advised him to move to other hospitals or a government run institute,\" said Dr Gupta. Dr Gupta admitted that the patient had approached dialysis unit but the same was denied. \"If a dialysis machine is used on a patient suffering from HIV, it not only affects the other machine due to same pipes interconnected but needs sterilisation too, which isn't a very simple procedure\", explained Dr Gupta. He said there are presently 60 patients admitted in the hospital and 35 of them are on dialysis. \"We cannot use the machines on HIV patients at the cost of treatment to other patients\", he said while attempting to justify the hospital's decision."

A layman's perceived threat of illness from a patient can still find some takers. However, medical practitioners refusing to conduct a postmortem of a person, just because he was an HIV victim, defeats the very purpose of the campaign to sensitize public about HIV patients. A team of doctors at SMS hospital allegedly refused to conduct postmortem of an HIV positive patient who committed suicide on Sunday evening at his residence in Harijan Basti. They cited 'infection risk to staff' as the reason. Furthermore, the doctors even asked the deceased's family members to give it in writing that they don't want a postmortem report. The police officers, however, were adamant. According to the police, around 9.30 pm on Sunday they received information about a 23-year-old youth, an HIV patient, who had committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling fan in his house. He was fighting the disease for the past six months. The police said that he was upset about his health condition which prompted him to take the fatal step. A team from the Sadar police station rushed to the spot, and took him to the SMS hospital where he was declared brought dead. A team of doctors, however, refused to conduct the post-mortem of the body. They even urged his family to give a written consent stating they don't want to go for a post-mortem. \"Since it was a suicide, it was compulsory for us to furnish documents like postmortem and viscera reports. The doctors tried convincing the family of the deceased,\" said Rajendra Singh, circle inspector, Sadar police station on Monday. The police, finally, had their way and by 11 am the doctors had started with the procedure."

There will be zero new infection, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero stigma and discrimination,\" said M Kalirajan, district programme manager for Prevention and Control of HIV-AIDS. Although the campaign has been conducted throughout the year through non-governmental organisations, partner organisations and other government departments, the campaign using folk arts, including Oyilattam and Karakattam would attract the attention of the public. Instead of conventional campaigning such as talks and issuing pamphlets, the message conveyed through folk songs would be well received by the people, the officials said. \"The campaign would cover all the rural pockets. We have 13 unions to cover in 16 days. It would be conducted in 49 places. We have allotted four days to cover the city, where campaigns would be conducted in 11 places,\" said Kalirajan. Apart from oyilattam and karakattam, kummi, puppetry, therukoothu, street plays would also be conducted. A team consisting of seven artistes and one musician including two women, who have been trained by experienced trainers, would be present during the campaign. Songs and themes for dramas have been prepared, said the official. \"We have planned to distribute booklets containing information on HIV/AIDS, other sexually-transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, blood donation, prevention of parent to child transmission and integrated counselling and testing centres during the campaign.

In 1986, Dr Solomon, a microbiologist with the Government General Hospital, Chennai, announced that six women sex workers had been found to be infected by the virus. None of the women is alive to tell about the trauma they underwent because of the stigma. \u201cMany things have changed since then. We have drugs that can bring down viral loads. But awareness among youth remains low,\u201d said Dr Solomon, who heads YRG Care, an NGO. Studies in many countries have shown that teens are more likely to have unplanned pregnancies and contract sexually transmitted diseases. \u201cWe have already delayed introduction of sex education in schools,\u201d she said. Many schools in countries like the US, Australia and France promote frank discussions with teenage students on anatomy, puberty, pregnancy and the risks of unprotected sex. The idea is to tell students to wait till they are old enough to experiment. In India, generally parents and teachers are shy to discuss such topics with children. Dr Solomon said that often when she interacts with schoolchildren, their teachers leave the room. She has been conducting such awareness programmes in schools. \u201cMost of the children hadn\u2019t seen a condom. I tell them all about it and also how to use it. I am not encouraging them to have sex. In fact, I tell them to delay or abstain. If they don\u2019t listen to what I say, they will at least know to be safe,\u201d she said. Sex education is a prickly subject despite Unicef spelling out the course module. Dr Solomon said the decline in prevalence of the viral infection had slackened international funding and the National AIDS Control Organization\u2019s programmes. Many NGOs have developed helplines and web-based services as cost-effective ways to reach out to adolescents. \u201cBut we need to shed inhibitions and be open to strengthen our battle against HIV/AIDS,\u201d said Dr Solomon."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Gurgaon will now be home to the country's first state-of-the-art laboratory that will exclusively work to design an effective vaccine against the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institute under the department of biotechnology (DBT), and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), have signed an agreement to jointly establish, operate and fund this HIV vaccine design programme. The programme will primarily focus on one of the greatest scientific challenges of AIDS vaccine design and development - the search of antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of circulating HIV strains. Bringing hope to the idea of developing an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, scientists have been working on powerful new antibodies that neutralise all major forms of the virus. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus. Studies have found that antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate - a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts in this Indian lab will now look at new antibodies and how they bind to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection. \"With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable to the fight against HIV and AIDS. A broadly effective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset to efforts to arrest the spread of HIV,\" said M K Bhan, secretary of DBT. This collaborative programme will participate in a coordinated, global effort to create replicas of virus targets in the laboratory for use as immunogens, which are the active ingredients of vaccines. The programme will have the task of developing, testing and then implementing strategies to rapidly screen large numbers of immunogens against HIV-1 (dominant strain) and to prioritize them for further evaluation in preclinical studies. \"We are very excited about the launch of this collaboration,\" said Seth Berkley, CEO of IAVI. Other institutions participating in this partnership include the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Indians, too, are being screened for such effective HIV slaying antibodies. The country has its share of \"late progressors\" or \"elite controllers\" - people infected with HIV who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). About one in 300 people with HIV is an elite controller. Meanwhile, another fascinating community - mainly comprising women - has also got scientists in India excited. Called \"exposed sero negative\" these are women who have, for years, had sex with HIV-positive, condom-refusing husbands, but never got infected. Many have also had babies who are not HIV-positive. Scientists are studying these elite controllers to see whether they carry special genes, which prevent the virus from multiplying in their bodies. The cure for AIDS may come from members of these two communities, scientists believe."

        "body": "PANAJI: HIV/AIDS cases have been on the decline during the last few years and a further significant drop was evident in 2014 as well. Data released by Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) indicates a drop in HIV/AIDS cases since 2009, thanks to extensive awareness about HIV/AIDS through a network of NGOs, and early detection which paved the way for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) given free at ART centres. A HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life. In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449. Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim. A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services. Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013. GSACS\u2019s annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013. Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase \u2014 this is also true of female patients. Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products. Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS. An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART. The GSACS now offers at GMC\u2019s ART centre the second line of ART also which was not available in Goa earlier. HIV patients with a failure of first line of ART, were referred to J J Hospital, Mumbai."

So these HIV positive children need extra care and proper medical attention, which will be provided at the hostel,\" chief district medical officer Koraput Nisikant Kar said. According to the medical officer, the life span of a HIV positive child is between 10 and 15 years and if proper medical attention and diet is provided then there is every possibility of prolonging their life span. \"Apart from medical treatment, the children will be provided with free food, clothes and imparted education at the hostel,\" he said. Officials said a budget of over Rs 50 lakh has been estimated for the project. The preliminary work has already begun and the hostel will become operational in the next few months. According to sources, there are around 1,300 HIV positive persons in the district and the number of children affected by the virus will be around 100. Hailing the administration's effort to take care of the HIV infected children's, social activists said the children should be brought up with the involvement of their respective communities. \"The decision to set up a hostel for the HIV infected children is a welcome move as there is no scheme to rehabilitate an orphaned HIV child in the district. However, the children when kept in the hostel may feel isolated from the society and discriminated by it.

Out of this, 1.5% of the cases were due to intravenous usage.So rampant have been the cases that chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently expressed concern over the menace and even asked the chief secretary to constitute a 'task force' headed by the additional chief secretary.IDU groups are categorised as high risk groups (HRGs) among other HRGs like 'men having sex with men' (MSM) and 'female sex workers' (FSW). IDU groups alone comprise 1.46% of the concentration of HIV epidemic as compared to 1.4% for MSM, and 0.46% for FSW, as per the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) data from 2010-11 to 2015.\"The new cases of injecting users being reported from the city are quite worrisome. IDU is a broad group. Casual injecting users are easily vulnerable as they do not pay attention to the condition of the syringe. There is a need for intervention so that new habitual users are diverted from syringes to opioid oral tablets under supervision,\" said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, Assam State Aids Control Society (Asacs).As per the 2015 AIDS Fact Sheet published by the Assam State Aids Control Society (Asacs), the annual occurrence of new HIV infections is showing a downward trend in high-prevalence states like Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. However, the trend is upward in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.The rate of increase in new HIV infections annually is the highest in Assam and Tripura. Intravenous drug practice is one of the contributing factors.Authorities have also expressed concern over the involvement of school students as users and as racketeers. \"The rise in drug usage is contributed to by a lack of awareness among the youths, their parents and educational institutions. Drug usage is a different set of disease and should be handled differently. The onus should be on harm reduction,\" said Rajeeb Sharma of Global Organisation for Life Development, a voluntary organization.AIDS experts and voluntary organizations have called for greater intervention and awareness generation among the youths to prevent them from using injecting and other forms of drugs. They have also suggested roping in parents and schools to combat the new menace."

Take the case of a woman from Mayyil panchayat in Thrissur who has been facing discrimination just because her husband has been tested positive for HIV. According to the woman, whose identity has not been disclosed, ever since her husband has been tested positive for HIV more than one and a half year ago, she has been facing ostracism and the local residents have not been sending their kids to the anganwadi, where she works. Though the authorities have permitted her to work there, she has been finding it difficult to tackle discrimination, the woman said. Mayyil panchayat president P Balan, admitted that despite repeated efforts parents have been reluctant to send their children to the anganwadi. \"The panchayat and the AIDS Control Society have taken steps to sensitise people and make them aware that nobody gets infected by physical contact with an HIV infected person. Moreover, it has not been confirmed whether she has been infected or not,\" he said. District collector Mir Muhammed Ali said the authorities have been trying to find an amicable solution instead of making a hasty decision, and added that it was unfortunate that a literate and progressive society was reinforcing discrimination towards those tested positive for AIDS. \"First of all, we cannot force her to undergo a medical examination to confirm whether she has been infected. At the same time, we have to operate the anganwadi. We are planning to appoint an additional staff and retain her,\" said the collector at a press conference in connection with the World AIDS Day. Such cases reflect the society's attitude and cannot be approved, said district panchayat president K V Sumesh, who urged the authorities to take initiatives to sensitise the society. On the World AIDS Day, the department has been planning to strengthen awareness campaigns, said deputy DMO A T Manoj, nodal officer of HIV related activities in the district. He said all efforts would be taken to convince the woman to undergo a medical examination to ascertain whether she has been infected, so that she could be provided medical support. \"We want to make sure she faces no discrimination but what is even more important is to provide her medical assistance in case she has been infected with the virus. But for that she has to voluntarily come forward to undergo the medical examination. Hence, we are in the process of providing her counselling apart from sensitizing the society,\" he said. District medical officer (DMO) K Narayana Nayak claimed stigma attached to the disease has been slowly coming down as also fresh cases of infection."

This has not only exposed the tall claims of the health authorities but also of the state aids control society of having spent crores of rupees on intensified awareness campaigns against HIV. It has also raised questions over the claim of drug control department and police tightening noose around chemists involved in selling of injectable drugs to addicts in Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar, Kurukshetra and Ambala belts. \u201cOf course, this is an alarming trend. We are doing our best to bring this under control. As far as HIV positive cases are concerned, drug abuse is the main cause of concern. We are in touch with police to nab errant chemists. At the same time, we have written to food and drug control department to intensify strikes on drug stores to check illegal sale of drugs,\u2019\u2019 said Dr Narveer Singh, director general of health services (DGHS) Haryana, who also holds the charge of project director of Haryana Aids Control Society (HACS). He said for STD cases, they have already roped in an NGO, adding that otherwise, the cities have shown a downward trend in urban areas. When contacted, some of the headmen in rural belts admitted to the loss due to drug addiction and assured of strict measures. \u201cPanchayats do take initiatives. We do not have any such case in our village so far. We are also taking additional measures to prevent HIV from spreading,\u2019\u2019 Jai Singh, former sarpanch of a village in Naraingarh sub-division, Ambala, said."

In March 2000, soon after having tested HIV positive, she gave birth to a son who also was diagnosed with the same disease. In 2005 she lost her husband to AIDS but that too did not see her falter. Armed with an iron-will she took up his job as a cable operator and battled on with her son who is now 17 year old. \u201cI urge people like me to live a healthy life with proper medical treatment,\u201d she said. Though nearly 2,000 people die of HIV AIDS in Gujarat every year, such cases are a beacon of hope for survivors of the deadly disease. The theme of this year's World AIDS Day on December 1 is \u201cHands Up for HIV Prevention\u201d. Many survivors in Gujarat exemplify this slogan today. According to the Union health ministry data, 2,155 HIV positive people have died last year in Gujarat alone. In 2014-15, the state witnessed 2,305 deaths due to HIV infection and in 2013-14 2,399 persons had died of AIDS. Gujarat is ranked fifth in the country for reporting large number of HIV-related deaths after Andhra Pradesh (12,670), Maharashtra (6,697), Karnataka (5,840) and Tamil Nadu (3,612). According to data compiled by National AIDS Control Organisation, Gujarat has 1.66 lakh people battling AIDS at present. Amid all the morbid facts, there are many who provide inspiration to the others to not give up. An elderly man, who lives in Paldi was shocked when he was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1998. Today, he has turned his life around and has become an inspiration for others living with the disease. \u201cInitially, I broke down completely when I came to know that I was diagnosed with HIV. My business too collapsed owing to this. But later I decided to fight back and I learned to live with the disease. I am now helping others to live a full life even with AIDS,\u201d he said."

However, the ban on HIV-positive foreigners who are looking to work in Singapore or accompanying a child studying here and intend to stay for a long period is still in place. The ban on short-term HIV-positive visitors was lifted on April 1, but it stays on long-term visitors, The Straits Times reported on Monday. \"The policy on the repatriation and permanent blacklisting of HIV-positive foreigners was recommended in the late 1980s when the disease was new, fatal and no effective treatment was available,\" a ministry of health spokesman was quoted as saying by the daily. The short-term ban was lifted \"given the current context with more than 5,000 Singapore residents living with HIV and the availability of effective treatment for the diseases.\" \"Lifting the short-term travel restrictions... poses very low additional risk of HIV transmission to the local population,\" the spokesman said. However, the public health risk posed by long-stayers is not insignificant, hence the restriction on long-term visits has been retained. The Singapore rule is similar to immigration laws in other countries like Australia and New Zealand, he added. Foreigners in Singapore, excluding permanent residents and spouses of Singaporeans, found to be HIV-positive will be deported and put on a permanent blacklist. A spokesman for advocacy group 'Action for Aids' has welcomed the change, but said the restrictions should also be lifted for long-term visitors. \"People living with HIV or Aids are not criminals and should not be banned from entering the country. \"(They) can and should be able to have fulfilling and rewarding lives, with loving relationships and be integrated as part of the community. Unfortunately, discrimination is still prevalent,\" the daily quoted the spokesman as saying."

While two-fifth of the total HIV infections are among women, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54% of the total cases. According to Nochiketa Mohanty, country programme manager, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, while there are programmes to prevent parent-to-child transmission of the virus, there is greater need to focus on women. \"There is huge need to ramp up education and awarnessness about HIV infection among women besides upgrading the social status of women in order to empower her to make choices related to her sexual partner,\" Mohanty said."

Three teams of 10 players each have been made, including various stakeholders. A handout on HIV is provided during the play. Interpersonal communication and group meetings during the game are also used to motivate the players and their friends to undergo HIV testing to promote safe behaviour, including the use of condoms. This is an ongoing activity and has been a successful way of promoting safe behaviour among the truckers. Truck drivers spend long periods of time away from home. Studies have shown that around a quarter to a third of long-distance truckers pay for sex whilst working away.

        "body": "BENGALURU: A recent survey conducted by the Sex Workers Study Committee has revealed that HIV-infected children are accepted only at five of the 57 gover nment-r un children homes. Activists allege that 91% of these centres have closed their doors to children, who test positive for HIV. The committee embarked on the survey following an incident in Hassan, where a 13-year-old girl with HIV was refused admission to a state-run-home. In all, there are eight HIV-infected children housed across five state-run homes \u00ad Bengaluru, Ramanagara, Dharwad, Raichur and Vijayapura. Child rights activist Roopa Hassan, who was part of the study committee, highlighted the glaring discrepancy between the actual capacity of these homes and their strength. \u201cThey can actually house 70 to 200 children, but they accommodate 30 to 50 at the most. The remaining seats remain vacant, while officials continue to get a steady flow of money for the total capacity from the government. They continue to refuse children despite the available room to house more,\u201c she said. On schools refusing admis sion to children infected with HIV , she said, \u201cIt is because of social stigma and taboo.\u201c She alleged that officials at the centres also told kids not to sit beside those with HIV , or to socialise with them. Lamenting the discriminatory practices in government institutions, she said, \u201cThe government should take the first step towards eliminating discrimination towards those with HIV , by increasing awareness among people that it is a noncommunicable disease.\u201c Sources said that the officials in charge of the homes, moved HIV-infected children to other NGOs after they had been admitted, but kept their names on the register to ensure the funds did not dry up. `Lack of accountability, scrutinizing system the problem' Thoracic surgeon and director of SDS Tuberculosis Research Centre and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi said, \u201cChildren homes were set up to rescue infected children, provide them adequate treatment and shield them from discrimination. However, reality works the other way round. Lack of accountability and a scrutinising system are the major problems. Although the government invests money and manpower into the cause, there is nobody keeping track of how they are used.\u201c Adding that the homes were required to admit HIV-infected children, Dr Buggi said, \u201cThey should send them to integrated counselling and testing centres to screen for other co-infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, bacterial and viral infections.They should be made to undergo CD4 (a glycoprotein in immune cells) count tests to know the status of body immunity on a daily basis.\u201c He said that people too had a responsibility to see that the government spent the money ear marked for protection and care of HIV-infected children efficiently. `Kids shifted to NGO-run centres for special care' District child protection officer (DCPO) at the Bengaluru urban child welfare committee, Divya Narayanappa said that no case of a HIV-infected child being refused admission had been officially reported. \u201cThere is one such home in the city , Bangalore Shishu Mangal, and no such case has been reported here. The home has admitted a HIV-infected boy . The efficiency and competence levels of district officers has increased since the formation of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme,\u201c she said. She did, however point out that in some cases wherein children were shifted from state-run homes since they might require special care and intervention.\u201cThere are instances when their health condition reaches a point beyond control that they need personal care, and they are moved to NGO-run centres, which exclusively provide for HIV children,\u201c she added. But, she said that any instance of discrimination, or attitude, was wrong, and needed to be brought to the notice of authorities. TIMES VIEW Efforts are being ramped up across the world to increase awareness on AIDS and HIV to remove the social stigma associated with the disorder. In India too, the government and many private organisations have been working towards ensuring that those with HIV are not discriminated against, and denied the right to a complete life.However, it is clear that these efforts have not percolated deep enough in our state. Children, affected by the disease for no fault of theirs, should not be the victims of discriminatory practices and the government must root them out."

Twenty-two among them are children. Of the total affected persons, 65% are youths,\u201d said chief district medical officer (CDMO), Kendrapada, Dr Binayak Prusti. HIV positive status means a person has the Human Immunodeficiency Virus in his/her bloodstream but the person\u2019s immunity has not been compromised enough to make him/her a full blown case. However, the person is capable of transmitting the virus either through sexual contact, transfer of blood and blood products and sharing needles, he said. Pattamundai , Rajnagar and Rajkanika blocks in the district have been identified as high-risk areas. \u201cThe disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well.

The councillor said the social stigma attached to HIV/AIDS make it difficult to detect cases as people belonging to the high-risk group don\u2019t give their consent for tests. \u201cLack of awareness and large population of migrants make it extremely difficult to combat the problem in the district,\u201d Biswal added.

While Abbott will provide study protocol and diagnostic equipment, YRGCARE will help in screening and sequencing rich patient data from infected populations in India. HIV and viral hepatitis are among the biggest public health threats in India today as they can produce many genotypes (genetic constitution of an individual organism), which keep combining to form recombinant strains or mutations making detection trickier. Understanding the distribution of genotypes and recombinants is critical to development of diagnostic tests. India has the third largest HIV incidence in the world -- more than 2.1 million people. Many of them are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). People, who inject drugs, and sex workers are identified as key affected populations. Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, chairman, YRGCARE, said drug-using populations in India bear a disproportionate burden of HIV and HCV, and it is critical to understand the transmissions in this group. \"Sequencing data in these affected populations will help us understand the evolutionary nature of the viruses enabling optimal treatment interventions to maximize impact,\u201d he said."

Of the total of 2.1 million individuals, 1.2 million are females. The total infected adolescent population in South Asia is 130,000 with 51% men and 49% women. Much more attention is needed to prevent and treat HIV during adolescence, so that children remain AIDS-free in the second decade of life. New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors. The treatment, care and support needs of children living with HIV change as they grow older and begin to take greater responsibility for their own health. But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them. Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations. This is in addition to investments in other sectors such as education, social protection and welfare, and strengthening health systems."

        "body": "Nagpur: In an effort to ensure that over the next few years the new generations are completely AIDS-free, the central government is giving free antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all the HIV positive pregnant women. Started in February 2014, the initiative is being taken very seriously by the two medical colleges in the city. Both the medical colleges in city have an ART centre. A new ART centre has also come up recently at Kamptee which has given an added option to patients. Yet, most continue to flock the two medical colleges only. Earlier, under the National AIDS Control Organisation\u2019s HIV positive pregnant women as well as the new born child were given a single dose of Nevirapine medicine under the PACT (Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission) programme. But this could only bring down the percentage of the HIV positive children to half (from 10 to 5%). But, since 2014, a new drug called Tenofovir Lamividine (TLE) is being given to HIV positive pregnant women all over India. They have to take a single pill everyday lifelong to ensure that both the mothers and their children do not get AIDS. This is a very effective drug. But it has to be taken every day lifelong by a HIV positive women. It works very well if patients adhere to the drug and take it daily at bedtime. It can completely prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. GMCH acting dean Dr PG Dixit told TOI that this was a novel effort on the part of the NACO. Since the launch of the programme in GMCH, 69 women have been on the new drug. All of them are adhering well to the therapy. The biggest advantage of the programme is that the patient has to just take a single tablet or pill as compared to the earlier regime of ART which included 2-3 drugs. It has also improved the compliance by patient. And since all women coming to government set up requiring anti natal care (ANC) are being screened 100% the chances of missing a positive case is very little. Earlier, HIV positive pregnant women were being screened for their CD4 count and only those with low count were given the ART treatment. But now every positive women is being given the therapy. Children earlier were followed for six weeks. But now children are also being followed till the age of five years. The only apparent problem that can create problem in functioning of the system is that the as per the central government plan the NACO is going to end the National AIDS Control Programme in phases by 2017 and hence has already started withdrawing from funding the projects. The programme has already been merged with National Rural health Mission. State governments are expected to take over the responsibility gradually. But since state government is not doing so problems of staff not getting salaries under the programme have already begun. PILL TALK * GMCH \u2014 69 HIV positive pregnant women put on the new single pill (TLE) since February 2014 * GMCH \u2014 67 children (18, 20 and 29 in year 2013, 14 and 15) below five years of age put under ART * IGGMC \u2014 130 of the 140 ANC women put on new drug regime since 2014 * ART centres in state \u2014 70 and link ART centres \u2014 140 * Number of state reference laboratories \u2014 16 * Number of community service centres in state \u2014 32 * Total people alive on ART in state (September 2014) 1,46,824 which include 71,816 men, 65,515 women and 9,493 children"

        "body": "MUMBAI: At a time when the HIV campaign is steering towards \u2018zero new infection\u2019, its prevention among high-risk groups in the city hangs between bad quality of condoms and complete unavailability of the same. Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence. Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies. A Malad-based CBO has often written to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. \u201cOur workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,\u201d said Gauri Sawant of the CBO. Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. \u201cCondom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,\u201d said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. \u201cSuper-lubricated condoms are not that useful. We must provide regular condoms with extra lubrication,\u201d he said. While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them. For NGOs working with female sex workers, it becomes a dual challenge. \u201cIt takes a lot of persuasion for a sex worker to convince a client to use a condom. The least NACO can ensure is to provide good quality condoms,\u201d said a CBO working with female sex workers. NACO refused knowledge of quality concerns. \u201cThere have been problems with supply, which will be streamlined soon. But we haven\u2019t been told of quality issues,\u201d said a senior official."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: India could soon see a national medical insurance policy for people living with HIV (PLHIV). In a meeting with insurance companies and the Insurance Regulatory Development Agency on February 3, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) will press them to make insurance \"inclusive and universal for PLHIV\". Currently, HIV is excluded from all insurance policies available in the country \"violating the national mandate of providing stigma free care and support services\". Union health ministry officials said that HIV/AIDS which was earlier regarded as a \"incurable disease\" has now become a \"manageable health problem\" and, therefore, should be included in medical insurance policies. \"Right now, there are individual health schemes in some states which cover certain healthcare related costs of PLHIV. Many health insurance policies exclude services to PLHIV and there is need for a package designed specially for such people. We will discuss global best practices to see how a viable insurance policy can be created for them,\" joint secretary Aradhana Johri told TOI. Another ministry official said, \"Those living with HIV are living longer and have less morbidity cases, thanks to the increase in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage. With timely initiation of ART, PLHIV may live a normal life up to 20 more years. Companies need to realize that covering HIV patients with a medical policy is no more a loss making proposition.\" India with a HIV prevalence rate of 0.31% is home to the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world -- 23.9 lakh. Some countries with higher prevalence rates of HIV have already taken measures to mainstream HIV through commercial health insurance cover. These include South Africa (17.8), Namibia (13.1), Uganda (6.5), Guyana (1.2) and United States (0.6). K K Abraham, chief of Indian Network of People Living with HIV, said, \"Insurance is life saving for us.\" At present, only Star Health and Allied Insurance has an insurance policy for PLHIVs in four states -- Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. More than 7,000 PLHIVs have subscribed to this insurance which provides a health cover of Rs 30,000 with a yearly premium Rs 1,511. NACO says that with about 89% of all HIV/AIDS infections being in the 15-49 age group, it effects in the most productive years. Currently, the financial burden of treatment and care is shared by NACO and PLHIVs. While NACO pays for ART, PLHIVs face economic burden of travel, nutrition and loss of wages. Recently, India launched the national health insurance scheme, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), for BPL. It is to be rolled out in 366 districts in 29 states. As on December 23, 2010, a total of 22,354,462 smart cards have been issued across 260 districts in 27 states. NACO says, \"HIV has been taken out from the exclusion list making it possible for poor PLHIVs to be covered under health insurance, which can make them entitled to one time hospitalization for nearly 700 in-patient procedures with costs up to Rs 30,000 by paying a minimal registration fee of Rs 30 per annum.\""

According to Punjab State Aids Control Society, of the 2.88 lakh people it had tested for the virus up to February 2014 under the HIV/Aids National Control Programme, 4,338 had been detected with the virus. The figure rose to 5,241 in April 2015, by when the number of people tested for the virus had risen to 3.97 lakh. A doctor at Ludhiana's government-run anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre, which is responsible for taking care of HIV/Aids patients, said the number of people diagnosed with the virus had now risen to 6,000. The worst affected is a village in the district from where 250 cases have been reported so far. The doctor at the ART centre refused to be identified for the claim as he was not authorized to speak to media on the subject. According to a report by the society, the leading causes of virus transmission in the district are use of same drug syringe and lack of use of contraceptive to protect from the virus. The sarpanch of the village where 250 cases of the virus have been reported said, \"People involved in menial jobs are most the common carriers here.\" A nurse working in the same village said many people in the village had stopped stepping forward to get tested for the virus. \"There are an equal number of men and women with the virus. No one comes to the village health centre and all of them prefer to be treated at Ludhiana civil hospital and other places because of the stigma attached to the virus,\" she said. The doctor at ART centre said he could not give more information about the virus as he was not authorized to speak on the subject. \"I cannot reveal any further information,\" he said."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) for the first time has recommended HIV self-testing in the privacy of one\u2019s home using HIV kit, a move that may result in a major breakthrough in HIV treatment by improving access to diagnosis. Though India currently does not allow HIV self-test, the UN agency\u2019s guidance has even prompted the health ministry here to evaluate the proposal. \u201cWe will certainly look at WHO\u2019s recommendations and evaluate how it can be adopted,\u201d said C K Mishra, secretary to the health ministry. The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease. Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally, around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status. Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice. HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less. Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. A senior official said, India may initially adopt the UN agency\u2019s suggestions for self-testing among high risk communities where the incidence and chances of spread is higher. \u201cMillions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others,\u201d said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO. In 2015, the total number of people living with HIV in India were estimated at 21.17 lakh, whereas 86,000 new HIV cases were found."

BSACS project director Sanjeev Sinha said the society is not getting the requisite amount of drugs from Naco and national programme officer (ART) in Naco, New Delhi, Dr B B Rewari, said the requisite drugs have already been sent to all states. He said, while talking to TOI over the phone, \"This was a problem some time ago. But all required drugs have been dispatched to all the states last week itself. It is now for the respective state bodies to ensure proper distribution of drugs.\" Patients at 13 ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres in the state say either they have been returned empty-handed from the centres or made to do rounds of these centres. Subhash Prasad (48) of Lakhisarai, who is registered with Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) ART centre, was told there was no medicine when he went there last time. When he went there for the second time on Wednesday, he was given medicines just for two days. \"Doctors say medicines should not be discontinued. But it is not economically viable for me to come to PMCH every fifth day,\" he rued. Similarly, 50-year-old Mohammad Rameez of Katihar said he got medicines only for two days this week. Kamla Devi, who hails from a village under Bhagwanganj police station, was in tears narrating her tale. \"My 13-year-old son returned empty-handed last time when we visited the PMCH centre. On Wednesday too, I reached there in the morning but they asked me to wait. I am a widow and have no source of income,\" she said. Ironically, the social stigma attached with the disease has not yet wiped off despite a number of awareness campaign carried out by governments and social organizations. Patients are harassed by Doyen, the private pathology service provider at PMCH. \"They straightaway refused to take my blood sample. When I insisted, they asked me to buy a special pair of gloves for the person who will collect my blood sample,\" said Manu Sah, a telecom firm employee at Patna. The story of those registered with Rajendra Memorial Research Institute is no different. Meena Rani (ART no 6027), who went there on Friday, said, \"I was not given any medicine because it wasn't there.\" Doctors say first and second line of treatment at private shops costs Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 per month respectively. President of Bihar Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS Society, Gyan Ranjan, said over 100 patients from Mothihari, Muzaffarpur and Chhapra ART centres returned without drugs from the respective centres this week. \"I have written numerous mails to BSACS, but to no avail.\" BSACS governing council member and physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said ART drug suppresses HIV virus and restores immunity system of the body which is destroyed by the virus. If there is a gap in medication, the virus becomes resistant and the treatment fails. He further said, \"If first line of medication fails, second line of treatment is prescribed. If that too fails, then it is a death sentence because third line of treatment is not available. The immune system of the body stops functioning.\" (Names of all patients have been changed)"

The move has caused an uproar in local dailies and users of Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter, are shocked at the medical ignorance displayed by the government. \u201cThere is no evidence that people can be infected with HIV in public bathhouses,\u201d Wu Hao, from the Beijing Research Centre on Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Aids, was quoted as saying by the Beijing Morning News. \u201cApparently, the rule to bar HIV patients from entering public bathhouses is way over the top,\u201d he said. The high level of disapproval also emerged in interviews of other activists conducted by the paper. \u201cBanning HIV patients from using public bathhouses and spas will only exacerbate people\u2019s misunderstanding, discrimination and fear of HIV/Aids and will not help reduce the transmission of the disease,\u201d it quoted an unnamed activist as saying. The United Nations\u2019 Aids agency has also expressed worry over the move. \u201cUNAIDS recommends that restrictions preventing people living with HIV from accessing bathhouses, spas and other similar facilities be removed from the final draft of this policy,\u201d Hedia Belhadj, the China coordinator of the agency was quoted by AFP as saying.

Significantly, the district of Lahaul & Spiti has not reported AIDS cases in the four-year period and districts Kangra, Hamirpur, Mandi and Bilaspur reporting most number of cases, followed by Solan, Shimla, Chamba, Kullu and Sirmaur.

Deep Chand (name changed), sobbing inconsolably, is an embodiment of that mortifying scare. In the past three months, 38 people from this locality of Bangarmau tehsil have been found HIV positive at screening camps in the past three months. The needle of suspicion is pointed towards a quack, Rajendra Yadav, who has been held. Till a few months ago, Deep Chand was just like most men from Prem Ganj, working as a 'palledar' (loader) at the nearby grain market. But a few months ago, his body started saying 'no' to humongous sacks he would carry on his back to make a living. Continuous excruciating pain in the lower back took him to Yadav's Station Road clinic in Bangarmau, the destination for many in his neighbourhood needing cheap medical help. But relief eluded him. Last month, at a camp in Prem Ganj to screen HIV cases he, along with his wife and son, tested positive. Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free. He also has four daughters. But fearing worst, he has not made them undergo the test. \"I am not fit and don't earn like before. What will happen if they, too, are tested positive? Medicine is free, but I don't have money to take six people to Kanpur. I can't even afford the cost of copies and pencils,\" he vents his angst. Two other nearby villages under the virus onslaught are Chakmeera and Kidmiyapur. Among the victims is a 70-year-old and also six-year-old girl. Her parents, however, are not infected. This has flummoxed local health officials. Rajendra Yadav, who would run his clinic from the corridor of an old Sanskrit school on the Station Road and is said to have infected many from the locality with infected syringes, was Dr 'Fixit' for the people. As per Deepu, a local youth, patients would make a beeline before his clinic before he would open it at 9am. Till the time he would call it a day around 11pm, he would have seen more than 150 patients. \"People from adjoining areas would also throng his dispensary. He used to charge Rs 10 for three doses of medicine and an injection shot. He would carry a 'jhola' in which he usually kept his medical kit, including used syringes, which he would wash from the hand-pump water,\" Deepu says. Prem Ganj came under the radar of health officials in November last when 13 people from the locality tested HIV positive at a camp held by UP State Aids Control Society. At three repeat camps in the last week of January, 25 more cases popped up. \u201cNearly 270 people from Prem Ganj had got themselves examined at the camps out of which 25 tested positive. Now, people are scared and are not willing to get themselves tested,\u201d says Sunil Kumar, a local municipal corporator."

        "body": "THANE: Hailing it as a defining moment against the deadly HIV virus, the Thane District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) said the prevalence of the disease has slipped sharply in recent years in Thane and Palghar districts. From a high of 5,154 HIV affected cases detected in 2010-11, the number fell to 3,129 in 201-16 and has further halved to 1,440 up to October 2017. In case of expecting mothers the numbers slid from a high of 261 in 2010-11 to 153 women who tested positive for HIV virus in 2015-16 and the latest figures up to October 2016 indicate only 85 women were HIV positive . The fall in the HIV positive cases in Thane and Palghar districts is a crucial indicator that the awareness campaign and sensitization programmes organized by the state and voluntary groups in the last 30 years have shown positive results. \u201cThe figures are extremely relevant as there is high mobility due to the national and state highways passing through them. The truck drivers and cleaners were notorious to buy cheap sex along the roadside and were potential carriers, passing it on to their wives back home and possibly to their children. However, the awareness drive helped as the HIV positive cases dropped drastically even as the number of people who opted for HIV tests in the recent years rose,\u2019\u2019 said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of DAPCU. He, however, cautioned that though there is an overall decline in positive cases, Thane and Mira-Bhayander top the list of cities where the virus remains a thereat just as it was five years ago. \u201cWith 843 people testing positive for HIV virus in 2015-16, Thane, Mira-Bhayandar townships are leading with high count of HIV patients, followed by Navi Mumbai with 710 cases in the same years and 444 and 334 cases detected in Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar-Kalyan-Dombivli townships. In the present year the situation remains the same,\u2019\u2019 he added."

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Raman said 800 pregnant women (as a representative of the general population) were tested randomly for HIV in Puducherry and none tested positive. Hence, the Union government officially announced that \u2018Puducherry has zero prevalence in HIV and stands first among all other states and Union territories of India\u2019. At present, the HIV prevalence in India is 0.28%. While prevalence is the actual number of cases with the disease during a period of time or at a particular date in time, incidence is the rate of new cases of the disease reported in a period of time e.g., per month or per year. The survey was a part of the Union government\u2019s HIV sentinel surveillance conducted once in two years through the National Aids Control Organisation, New Delhi, in all the states and Union territories of India. In the previous 2014 HIV sentinel surveillance, Puducherry was placed 10th with a prevalence of 0.13%. Puducherry also stood first with least HIV prevalence of 0.2% in \u201cthe men having sex with men\u201d (MSMs) among all states and Union territories.

        "body": "THANE: Residents from Thane have been affected the most with the killer HIV virus. Out of 2,304 HIV positive patients in the district, around 33% were from Thane city, including Mira Road and Bhayander. This was stated in the 2016-17 report of Thane\u2019s District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). However, there has been a drop in the number of cases in the entire district. The officials claimed that Thane city, comprising of Thane, Mira Road and Bhayander, had more people who belong to the high risk population. Navi Mumbai and Bhiwandi were among the top three places in the district that were detected with the most number of cases. \u201cThese cities not only have a high population, but also have people from the high risk zone \u2014like sex workers, migrants, transgenders, truck drivers, etc. It was also seen that out of the ones who were detected positive, 80% got infected due to unsafe sex. While others got it through blood transfusion. Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,\u201d said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU. The department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities. \u201cOut of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers. But there has been a rise in the number of patients taking the HIV test. This is because of the awareness drives we have been carrying out in these pockets. During these drives, we request those infected with the virus to come to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for tests,\u201d said Gadhave. However, there has been a drop in HIV positive cases in the district. This is an indication that the awareness drives and sensitization programmes organized by the state authorities and voluntary groups in the last seven years has shown positive results. While there were 5,154 HIV cases in 2010-11, the numbers came down to around 2,304 in 2016-2017."

The person from Saharsa district was admitted to the orthopaedic department on December 15 as his wound needs to be operated upon. During blood tests, it was found that the person was HIV positive. The kin of the person alleged on Friday that he and his family members were asked by a junior doctor on December 27 to leave the hospital after the test results. \u201cI have submitted a formal complaint to the superintendent\u2019s office.

PMCH deputy superintendent Dr R K Jamaiyar said it was the duty of the hospital to treat the person. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a special OT as like in the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). After operating upon any such person, we close the OT for two days, sterilize it and provide the doctors all the necessary kit,\u201d Dr Jamaiyar said. He said the doctors also suggest the family concerned to get the person operated upon at IGIMS, which has all the facilities. When contacted, principal in charge of PMCH, Dr Khurshid Alam said a committee would be formed to conduct an inquiry into the case. \u201cI have already asked orthopaedic department HoD Dr Vijay Gupta to submit to me the details of the treatment plan for the person,\u201d he added. \u201cThe committee will conduct the necessary investigation and take appropriate action in case there is any fault on the part of any doctor or employee of the hospital,\u201d Dr Alam said."

        "body": "Jaipur: Those living with HIV will now have to submit their Aadhaar card numbers to Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS). The move is, however, being seen as a \u2018ridiculous\u2019 one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV. When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card\u2019s photocopy. \u201cThey asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,\u201d the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said. The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries. \u201cOther departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,\u201d said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS. In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV. Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART. Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS. \u201cHIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,\u201d said activist Nikhil Dey. Dey said, \u201cOnce it\u2019s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.\u201d Social activists termed the step as \u201cridiculous\u201d. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres."

Take the case of a woman from Mayyil panchayat in Thrissur who has been facing discrimination just because her husband has been tested positive for HIV. According to the woman, whose identity has not been disclosed, ever since her husband has been tested positive for HIV more than one and a half year ago, she has been facing ostracism and the local residents have not been sending their kids to the anganwadi, where she works. Though the authorities have permitted her to work there, she has been finding it difficult to tackle discrimination, the woman said. Mayyil panchayat president P Balan, admitted that despite repeated efforts parents have been reluctant to send their children to the anganwadi. \"The panchayat and the AIDS Control Society have taken steps to sensitise people and make them aware that nobody gets infected by physical contact with an HIV infected person. Moreover, it has not been confirmed whether she has been infected or not,\" he said. District collector Mir Muhammed Ali said the authorities have been trying to find an amicable solution instead of making a hasty decision, and added that it was unfortunate that a literate and progressive society was reinforcing discrimination towards those tested positive for AIDS. \"First of all, we cannot force her to undergo a medical examination to confirm whether she has been infected. At the same time, we have to operate the anganwadi. We are planning to appoint an additional staff and retain her,\" said the collector at a press conference in connection with the World AIDS Day. Such cases reflect the society's attitude and cannot be approved, said district panchayat president K V Sumesh, who urged the authorities to take initiatives to sensitise the society. On the World AIDS Day, the department has been planning to strengthen awareness campaigns, said deputy DMO A T Manoj, nodal officer of HIV related activities in the district. He said all efforts would be taken to convince the woman to undergo a medical examination to ascertain whether she has been infected, so that she could be provided medical support. \"We want to make sure she faces no discrimination but what is even more important is to provide her medical assistance in case she has been infected with the virus. But for that she has to voluntarily come forward to undergo the medical examination. Hence, we are in the process of providing her counselling apart from sensitizing the society,\" he said. District medical officer (DMO) K Narayana Nayak claimed stigma attached to the disease has been slowly coming down as also fresh cases of infection."

Her initial reaction to the diagnosis was utter shock and much to her expectation, her life became a living hell. Deserted by all, she was leading a life of solitude and loneliness. There were many women like her in Bharatpur district who were facing similar experiences. Having contracted HIV after working as sex workers, they had no one to share their problems with and were totally down with stress and depression till they came across an intervention programme being run there by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) and voluntary organisation Lupin Human Welfare & Research Foundation. Under this programme, a mass awareness programme was undertaken for HIV prevention and on the risk factors associated with HIV infection among the sex workers in the Bharatpur district. They were identified as a key factor for the spread of HIV. Then a strategic approach for confronting the crisis through safe sex by promotion of condom was initiated on a large-scale. Outlets were created in 11 hot spot areas where condom were freely available for the clients visiting them. In the past one year, 302 sex workers of Bedia community were registered for target intervention. The foundation ensured that the stigma and rejection of such women is stopped by education and creating an awareness, advocacy and sensitisation. Drop-in centres were established for a one-to-one meeting of all such sex workers to discuss their problems and share information of mutual interest. Women were encouraged to form self-help groups to facilitate them to join the mainstream of development activities and to spread awareness amongst their community on HIV prevention. Provision for clean drinking water, hut insurance coverage, training for income generation activities like manufacturing of \u2018Tulsi malas\u2019 etc were also conducted for their benefit. Various health camps were organised at the hot spots to encourage HIV testing at voluntary counselling and testing centres in government hospitals. It was ensured that women suffering from sexually-transmitted infections are treated at private clinics, where the doctors and staff have been specially trained for handling them. The medicine at these clinics were distributed free of cost."

This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when over two HIV+ cases were recorded per day. While men constituted 60% of the total number of HIV+ cases in the first trimester of this year, no transgenders and transsexuals were detected with the condition for the second year in a row. Mormugao continued to be the taluka with the highest number of HIV+ cases (27%), while Salcete came in second at 16%. Bardez, the taluka that had in the past years reported the second-highest and, sometimes, highest number of HIV+ cases in the state, accounted for only six of the total cases in the first three months of 2018. No new cases were reported from Sattari, Sanguem and Canacona. The predominant mode of transmission of HIV has continued to be the sexual route, with over 90% of such cases reported. Transmission modes involving infected syringes, needles, blood and blood products have been negligible in the state. Although five deaths due to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in January and February this year, chief medical officer of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Chandrakant Parab, said the launch of the \u2018test and treat\u2019 policy last April is expected to reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths further.

Since the implementation of the \u2018test and treat\u2019 policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state. \u201cART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children,\u201d Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life. Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. \u201cThose indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable,\u201d he added."

        "body": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS strips a person of immunity and is an irreservible condition with no known cure. The condition, itself, suffers from opinion- based 'facts' that float around in public opinion offline and, as a result, online. Today, to clear out the confusion, we filter the facts about AIDS and separate the myths from the must-know information. If you believe a mosquito bite can spread HIV and that you are insusceptible to HIV then here are 10 facts about AIDS that will change your perspective on HIV and AIDS. Facts about AIDS: Faithful sexual partner and condoms equal safe sex Condoms are considered 100 percent protection to AIDS, but the truth remains that condoms can tear and can have microscopic holes. This tends to happen if the condoms are not stored properly or they may have passed the expiry date. Tear in the condom can be attributed to strong carnal emotions. But yes, condoms and a faithful partner reduce the chances of contracting HIV. Facts about AIDS: Oral sex can cause AIDS To demystify oral sex \u2013 mouth and tongue touching the genitals. And this can cause the spread of HIV and AIDS if the partners have cuts ore sores in the mouth and the private parts. You can contract HIV through fingering too, especially if you have cuts or sores on your finger. But the risks are lower than unprotected sex; this doesn\u2019t give you a free ticket to have oral sex. The transfer of HIV is like a spy, who can slip through surveillance camera without a glitch. Facts about AIDS: You can share your toilet and cutlery with an HIV or AIDS patient The HIV virus mainly survives within the body, the virus has low chance of surviving externally, outside the body. The HIV virus can only survive on a cell, hence the virus withers away within minutes to an hour depending on the volume of the fluid. Shaking hands, sharing toilets and swimming pools should not stop you from interacting or discriminating an HIV or AIDS patient. Facts about AIDS: Your child can contract HIV if the mother is pregnant The child can contract HIV before or after birth. The virus can be transmitted during breastfeeding too. But there are drugs that can greatly reduce the chances of transferring HIV virus. But the best option recommended is a caesarean section delivery and to avoid breastfeeding. Facts about AIDS: You need to use protection even if you and your partner has HIV Unprotected sex between two partners who are infected with HIV can result in exposure to other strains of the HIV virus. It is suggested to have protected sex at all times to prevent a deadly strain of the virus. Facts about AIDS: Mosquito bite does not cause HIV There are some points to remember here: - There is not evidence to vouch that mosquitoes can spread HIV - The virus does not survive with a mosquito for along time - Lastly, insects do not inject the blood into person when they \u2018bite\u2019 Facts about AIDS: Cure for HIV Antiretroviral drugs can add life to your years and give you a normal life, but it cannot cure you completely of this parasitic virus. The HIV virus has the ability to adapt to the antiretroviral drugs, hence it is consumed with other medication. If you believe you are infected with the HIV virus in the last 72 hours, post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP drug can kill the HIV virus. Facts about AIDS: HIV does not discriminate Many of us believe we cannot contract HIV. We want to believe that the poorest of the poor are more likely to contract HIV or the rich are likely to contract it. But the fact remains that HIV does not discriminate on your bank balance, colour of your skin or country. The HIV virus will thrive on living human cell no matter your identity. Facts about AIDS: You can still spread HIV even if you\u2019re getting treatment The treatment reduces the virus in your body but the treatment does not kill the virus completely. Hence it is still advised to practice safe sex. It is possible to pass on the HIV virus to your partners and others even if you are getting treatment. Facts about AIDS: Having sex with a virgin cures AIDS This is myth; it\u2019s as good as saying that having ice cream will cure your cold. It is also believed that having sex with a disabled individual can cure HIV and AIDS. Read more Personal Health, Diet & Fitness stories on www.healthmeup.com"

This has recently been proved in a research of anti-HIV drug at National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Mohali in Punjab. The algae and herbal plant have chemicals with potent anti-viral structure. Imitating these structures, a compound has been synthesized to fight HIV type 1 virus. A patent has been filed as this is the first such compound which has shown a protection rate of 78.17% against the HIV virus (the standard percentage is 89.75). The project, which has been completed recently and collaborated with National Centre for Cell Science, Pune University, had been sponsored by the Department of Biotechnology, Delhi. The main objective behind developing such a compound was to introduce another set of compounds and their family which are not yet resistant to the HIV virus. The principal investigator of the project, Prof KK Bhutani said, \u201cThere are existing therapies, which have effectively suppressed the virus replication and prolonged the life of such patients. But there are mutant viruses resistant to the current drugs.\u201d He added, \u201cSo, we took up this project of development of new types of anti-HIV drugs based on the chemical structure of some of the plants which have been known for possessing anti-infection properties.\u201d The Pune University had done all the preclinical trials on animals to test the efficacy of the compound. \u201cThe toxicity tests have been successfully completed. Plants were screened and only those were selected for imitation and modification of the structure which had properties of anti-infection,\u201d said Keyur Brahmbhatt, a doctorate student at NIPER, who was a part of the study."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: For several years, Asha Jat was just a 27-year-old homemaker from Ajmer who had tested HIV positive and was shunned by society. Then four years ago, she was introduced to a health project that helps HIV positive mothers avail medical assistance for themselves and their child. Now Asha is one of the 25 volunteers for the project in Rajasthan's Ajmer district and has facilitated 102 childbirths of HIV positive women in the last four years. The project titled, Reduction of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV in India: Improving access of Positive Women to Public Health Services (PPTCT), was launched in three states \u2014 Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in 2009. \"The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,\" says Asha. Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme\u2014III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non\u2013stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers. According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. \"More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,\" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday. District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up. \"The project enables a woman or mothers to go to heath services and say \"I am HIV+, my child is negative and I need medical assistance,\" said Akhila Sivdas, executive director, Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) that advocates for informed representation about gender and development issues such as HIV/AIDS, child rights and violence against marginalised groups. The PPTCT project was implemented by the Positive Women's Network (PWN+), a Tamil Nadu Voluntary Health Association (TNVHA), Arogya Agam, Tamil Nadu and Society for People's Action for Development (SPAD), Karnataka. According to Padmavati, president (PWN+) Tamil Nadu, the project is making a big difference in tribal districts such as Nilgris, Theni and Coimbatore. \"In those places the volunteers are literally the lynchpins of the programme. Every village has a volunteer network and the women, though they don't get an honorarium, are happy to work as volunteers because they have had positive children themselves and they do not want others to go through the same experience\". Citing a highpoint of the programme, Padmavati described how a volunteer secured 30 ration cards (a necessary document for securing various government healthcare facilities) from the Coimbatore collector for the HIV+ women of the area in a single day. For Gajalaxmi, Sex Workers Collective from Trichi district, the lack of such documents led to sex workers facing discriminations towards their rights and entitlements. \"If other women have to make two-three visits to avail of an entitlement, a sex worker would have to go 10-12 times. Even today 50% of them do not succeed in getting their entitlements,\" she said. Tracing the journey undertaken by the Christian Aid, EU and four other civil society organizations in extending PPTCT services to positive women, Semeda Steve, programme manager, Christian Aid maintained that since the programme began the response from HIV positive women has gone up from 7% to 93% in intervention areas. On the occasion a report, Standing Shoulder to Shoulder: Documentation of Best Practices (stories from Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Karnataka), was released by Syeda Hameed, member, Planning Commission."

        "body": "KOLHAPUR: The district has in the past year registered a noticeable decline in cases of HIV infection, including parent-to -child transmission. Around 1,024 patients have been found infected with the virus till November this year as against last year's 1,824. The parent-to-child virus transmission has also come down from 67 in 2012 to 23 this year. There are four anti-retroviral treatment centres (ARTs) and link ARTs across the district to clinically examine the suspected patients. After a person is tested positive, the ART medication starts at the earliest. Jagdish Patil, the regional programme officer of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), told TOI, \"We are targeting those in the high-risk groups such as male and female sex workers, and trans genders, who are most vulnerable, to spread the awareness about the syndrome. As this group is brought under control, the spread of the virus to the secondary population, such as spouses and children of these people, also decreases. We have brought around 90% infected people to ART centres to provide medication which has significantly reduced the spread.\" The District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), along with the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), is going to conduct a survey among those engaged in cutting of sugarcane for HIV infection. \"The sugar cutters are mostly migratory workers and considered the bridge-population for the virus to spread. However, there is no study about how much these people contribute to the spread of virus. However, the population has the potential risk of transmitting the virus through unsafe sex,\" Patil added. Along with the decline in the AIDS cases among the general masses, the district has also recorded a dip in in the parent-to-child transmission of the virus. \"Last year, about 67 children were infected through their HIV -positive mother. This year, the number has been significantly declined because of te co-ordinating efforts of private and public anti-natal care centres. A single-dose regimen of Nevirapin has reduced the transmission rate from 30% to 11%. We will start the triple drug regimen that can bring down the rate further to 2-5%,\" Patil said."

        "body": "MUMBAI: In Modi sarkar, ministers and bureaucrats have it easy. They are only required to work 18 hours a day and keep their mouths shut when the media calls. Citizens have a tougher job, however. They will not only be required to brave all the price increases that the Modi government is dishing out but will also be subjected to a government sponsored, taxpayer-funded ad blitz that will extol the virtues of marital fidelity in an attempt to combat the dreaded AIDS disease. Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan is an ear, nose, throat (ENT) specialist. So he sure knows how to pry out secrets of ill-health and treat patients. His diagnosis of India's battle with AIDS so far is that its citizens' moral fibre will have to strengthened if the disease has to be brought under control. In an interview to The New York Times, the health minister has said that the thrust of the AIDS campaign should not be only on the use of condoms as it sends the wrong message that \"you can have any kind of illicit sexual relationship, but as long as you're using a condom, it's fine.\" He added that the national campaign should also promote integrity of sexual relationship between husband and wife \u2014 \"a part of Indian culture.\" The emphasis on Indian culture is in keeping with the BJP's emphasis on highlighting what it calls positive aspects of Indian culture to combat lifestyle problems caused by excessive or socalled reckless adoption of western culture. READ ALSO: \u200bHealth minister questions stress on condoms in AIDS fight Right-wing Hindu organisations have been know to use force to shut down pubs and rail against 'indecent' dressing among women. This is, however, the first time since the government formation in May that a high-ranking minister has publicly endorsed cultural attributes in the fight against a major disease. Dr Harsh Vardhan, who was the BJP's chief ministerial candidate in the Delhi 2013 assembly elections, has already issued orders to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which is responsible for running the HIV prevention programme in the country. It has been advised to tone down the emphasis on use of condoms and instead promote morals to tackle the disease. \"For high-risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men, we will continue the emphasis on condoms as morals won't catch their attention,\" V K Subburaj of NACO told ET. \"However, for the general public the minister has asked to stress on morals like being faithful, not indulging in pre-marital and extra-marital sex,\" he added. \"The minister wants us to emphasise that just because condoms are available, one should not indulge in illegal sex,\" he added. This culture vs condom comment by the health minister has not gone down too well with HIV activists who believe that such statements defeat the purpose of years of efforts in tackling the disease. And it comes when the country is making headway in bringing down the number of HIV+ cases in India. Dr Harsh Vardhan remained unavailable on phone and an email sent to his official ID remained unanswered. NACO figures show that the rate of HIV in India has halved in the last decade. However, what remains a concern is the resurgence of the deadly disease in low prevalence states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh among others. They further say that half-baked information based on morality does more harm than educating people about safer sex. Anjali Gopalan of Naz foundation, an organisation that works with HIV patients, said that the idea of Abstinence, Be faithful, Use a condom (ABC) approach has been around for long, but doesn't always work. \"Just because condom is available, not everyone starts having sex,\" she said. \"Either ways you need to promote condom use.\" \"Sex happens in India irrespective of cultural taboos as we have found in our work, especially the helpline that ran for 13 years (1996-2009) and attended to over 60,000 calls,\" said Prabha Nagaraja, Executive Director, TARSHI, an organisation that works on reproductive and sexual health issues. She also pointed to a study done by the organisation, Population Council, in 2010 which showed that a large number of youth in both urban and rural India indulge in premarital sex and are often poorly educated about the risks associated with unprotected sex. \"So it is better to inform people about safe sex, including use of condoms instead of letting them rely on incomplete/misleading information,\" she added."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: As many as 87% of HIV-infected people are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus, according to government data. Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus. \u201cThe low level of awareness among HIV positive population is of concern because research shows that early diagnosis is crucial. It allows patients to start on treatment sooner, which can greatly reduce the risk of spreading the infection to partners. Detecting the virus early also improves health outcomes for infected patients,\u201d said Gerald Schochetman, senior director, Infectious Diseases and Diagnostic Research, Abbott. Government officials as well as health experts say the risk is more among the vulnerable population that practises high risk behaviour or have higher chances of HIV prevalence. This includes sex workers, trans-genders and even long-distance truckers. Over the years, counselling and testing centres across the country have increased with many private laboratories now offering HIV detection tests apart from the government centres. In 1997, there were just 67 HIV testing and counselling sites in India, whereas NACO data shows there over 15,000 healthcare facilities offering counselling and testing across the country in 2014. \u201cCounselling and testing services are important components of prevention and control of AIDS in the country,\u201d said Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective. Grover said instead of cutting corners with the vulnerable population by criminalizing them, government should counsel and provide them with proper care so that they do not transmit the disease further. \u201cIn the past few years, the number of infections has declined in India because we worked with the vulnerable population, distributed condoms and made them aware. One needs to partner them so that they help in not increasing the burden,\u201d Grover said. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world. There are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients."

The meagre Rs 200 pension, promised by the government two years ago, remains a dream for the HIV-positive patients. With a view to providing economic support to the HIV-positive patients, the government had decided to provide Rs 200 every month on a par with the physically handicapped, widows and destitutes, but the proposal remained only on paper. Konda Lakshmi (name changed) rued the lack of financial support from the government as well as her family. \u201cWe are left to fend for ourselves. A small gesture could have gone a long way in helping us financially,\u201d she pointed out.

Several HIV patients alleged that the government had washed its hands of by merely issuing ATM cards to them. \u201cThough the cards were issued three months back, not a single penny has been transferred to our savings accounts so far,\u201d complained another patient Sunnam Gangadhar (name changed). He also criticised the government for selecting a meagre number of patients for the pension scheme when thousands of people were afflicted with the disease in Nizamabad district. According to statistics, there are about 12,000 registered HIV-positive patients in the district. But the district authorities have selected only 1,250 patients for the Rs-200 pension scheme. As per the health guidelines, patients whose CD4 count is less than 250 and those who take medicines from the ART centres are eligible for the pension scheme. When contacted, district medical and health officer (DM&HO) Harinath said that there was delay in transferring the amounts to the savings accounts of the patients. S Siddaiah, who runs an NGO, demanded that the government provide essential commodities like rice, pulses, oil, sugar and others free of cost to the HIV patients. Recalling that HIV-positive patients were supplied 30 kg rice at Rs 2 a kg every month by issuing Anthyodaya card in 2009-10, he urged the government to take measures to protect the HIV patients."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Could an antibody from the blood of an Indian HIV patient help create the elusive HIV vaccine? (Antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances). The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS. Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative\u2019s (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006. So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells. \u201cOnly a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus\u2019s ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,\u201d experts said. Just a few weeks ago, department of biotechnology (DBT) cleared the proposal to roll out Protocol G in the country. It is being implemented by IAVI and YRG Care from Chennai \u2013 the same organization that isolated the first HIV case in India in 1986. The blood samples collected from the 100 volunteers will be tested at Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), which is being built in Gurgaon. IAVI\u2019s India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that \u201cThis is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.\u201d Careful study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens \u2014 the active ingredients of vaccines \u2014 that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine. The project has tested HIV patients in Thailand, the UK, the US, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Australia and Zambia to identify bNAbs. HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected. Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus \u2014 and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses. The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection."

        "body": "Jyoti Dhawale and Vivek Surve on finding love after HIV, and leading a sexually satisfying life as a mixed status couple The vows that Jyoti Dhawale and Vivek Surve exchanged on October 13 this year, with the blessings of lord Ram, Sita, Jagannath, Balram and Subhadra, weren\u2019t just the usual that Hindu couples do. Surve, art director at a leading publishing house, pledged to support Dhawale, 38, in her fight to lift the stigma off AIDS, and gradually tweak the mindset of those around them by being a model \u2018mixed status\u2019 couple. And that\u2019s not the only stereotype they are crashing. Dhawale is no emaciated, drawn HIV victim. She fills up the room when she hurries in. \u201cI can\u2019t hear,\u201d she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three. But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence. The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (\u201cOral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn\u2019t care for condoms\u201d) did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. \u201cPoz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,\u201d she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn\u2019t hold anyone accountable. \u201cThe nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.\u201d Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. \u201cI thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn\u2019t have them, neither did my husband.\u201d The Vasai clinic she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 \u2014 \u201cdue to incompatibility, not the infection\u201d, she clarifies \u2014 making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus. She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn\u2019t stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication. \u201cIn India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,\u201d she says, recounting how an \u2018AIDS specialist\u2019 she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. \u201cHe even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the saliva, it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It\u2019s the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,\u201d she clarifies. In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. \u201cHe disappeared for three months,\u201d she giggles. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not a single day went by when I did not think of her.\u201d Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve\u2019s family. After all, she had a \u2018sex worker\u2019s\u2019 disease. \u201cWe tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it\u2019s transmitted,\u201d says Surve, who admits that it\u2019s family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple. That Dhawale never let the virus rob her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a \u201crocking, fearless but protected sex life\u201d. \u201cThere are procedures to follow in case of a condom tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor\u2019s guidance,\u201d explains Surve. Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. \u201cIf you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,\u201d he says. Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? \u201cWith proper exercise, diet and medication,\u201d he says, \u201can HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.\u201d Ways to prevention Always use a condom. Have your partner tested for HIV before engaging in a physical relationship and/or marriage. Insist that labs, clinics and hospitals use disposable syringes and screens."

        "body": "BHUBANESWAR: After much dithering, the state government on Saturday said it would soon introduce the nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method for screening blood before transfusion. NAT PCR is regarded as the most accurate test to identify HIV infection, far more dependable than the Elisa and rapid test kit methods in which HIV may remain undetected for a prolonged window period. Making the announcement during an adjournment motion discussion in the Odisha assembly, health minister Damodar Rout said the test was quite costly and the government had decided to introduce the test at the three government-run medical colleges and the Capital Hospital in the first phase. It will be introduced at other places in a phased manner, he added. Admitting that two specific cases of HIV transmission through contaminated blood had come to the government's notice, the minister said, \"The government will take all required steps to ensure people have access to safe blood.\" Rout explained that the window period of HIV non-detection is 89 days in rapid test kits, and 21 days in Elisa method. In case of NAT PCR, the window period is only seven days. The minister further said the government had decided to abolish the rapid test method completely as it had the highest margin of error. The National AIDS Control Organization and National Blood Transfusion Council have no directives to conduct NAT PCR tests, but countrywide, around 20 blood banks use the method, he informed the house. Raising the motion earlier, Congress chief whip Prasad Harichandan wanted to know what steps the government had taken in view of the \"increase in instances of infected blood being given by blood banks.\" Citing a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the law maker said the prevalent methods were unsafe. The ICMR study, undertaken in various centres including the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008. It shows that the NAT PCR method can detect one HIV positive case in every 1,500 blood samples tested negative in the Elisa method. The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cost around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. An automated NAT PCR machine costs around Rs 3 crore. The Orissa high court, in July 28, 2011, had asked the state government to ensure that the NAT PCR method is used identify HIV infection. A bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order while hearing the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from Red Cross Blood Bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10-month old. He tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months."

With the shortage of delivery kits, which doctors wear while assisting in the delivery of HIV positive women, doctors and officials of Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) were in a fix. Thanks to the two stories published in The Times of India recently, pertaining to the shortage of delivery kits, a consignment of 420 kits, which officials estimate would see them through the next year, reached Madurai a week ago. A regular doctor has been posted in Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART), inside the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) premises, to announce HIV test results immediately, reacting to another story published in the paper in October. Sources from TANSACS said that they have received a consignment of 420 kits. \"During each delivery case of an HIV infected pregnant woman, five kits are needed for a team of doctors. On an average, 80 such cases are handled in Madurai district, majority of them in GRH. With the absence of kits for more than six months, TANSACS officials in Madurai had been managing by borrowing kits from other districts. There was an unnecessary delay in announcing the HIV test results conducted for suspected patients in GRH. The delay was due to the absence of dedicated doctors in the ART centre. Due to the delay, many HIV positive patients who were indifferent to the results could not be traced. Taking note of the news article published in TOI, a doctor has been assigned to the centre with mandatory attendance registry. When contacted, M Kalirajan, District Programme Manager for Prevention and Control of HIV-AIDS, confirmed that they have received the consignment of kits."

        "body": "MUMBAI: Amid apprehensions of diminishing global funds slowing down HIV prevention initiatives, the city has achieved a feat of sorts by bringing down the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) mortality to two this year. This is not only an 86% dip from the previous year, but also the lowest ever in the city since prevention initiatives kicked in 14 years ago. The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) made the figures public in the wake of World Aids Day on December 1. There has also been avisible difference in the number of people suffering from AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV. This year, 416 have got AIDS as opposed to 790 last year. Experts say the city has come a long way from 2004 when there was a jump in the figures with nearly 278 deaths. However, the state figures still paint a grim picture as 1,243 lives were losttill October this year. For the city though, there has been a decline even in the number of fresh cases. This year 9,973 tested positive for HIV as compared to 12,944 in 2011. Though the difference in dip may be less than 1% between the two years, it has surely halved as compared to five years back. In the past three years, over 2 lakh people walked into Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) out of which 5-8 % tested positive. This year too, out of 2.01 lakh who got tested, around 5% were positive. MDACS additional project director Dr Balkrishna Adsul attributed the dip to awareness and integrated approach by agencies. \u201cWe are aiming towards zero positive cases and deaths ,\u201d he said. Adsul said most of those who tested positive are in the 20-30 years agegroup. The MDACS figures also show a trend where more pregnant women are approaching the ICTC centres for testing and counselling. This year, 1.03 lakh pregnant women got tested for HIV out of which 365 tested positive. But, on the positive side, more children also seem to be getting Nevirapine, drug administered to babies born of HIV positive moms, soon after birth. Officially, the numbers say that 88.9% babies have received the drug that reduces their chances of getting HIV from 30% to around 12-15 %. An expert, however, maintained that unregistered deliveries still remain a grey area."

        "body": "LONDON: A new aggressive form of HIV can progress to AIDS in just three years - so rapidly that patients may not even realize they were infected, scientists say. Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV. Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said. One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane. In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS. Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS. The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes."

Talking to TOI, President of CNP+, Rinki Arora said the orphan child, who was living with his relatives in Durg, was on first line treatment but due to failure of medicines, he was referred to Raipur ART centre one year back. Rinki said since Raipur ART has the facility of providing second line drugs in the state, they had been pursuing the matter with them for the child\u2019s treatment but the same was being delayed on one pretext or the other. She said due to lack of treatment, the child\u2019s condition had started worsening and they contacted State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, who in turn directed the Raipur ART centre on Wednesday to start the treatment the very next day. Rinki said when they contacted the ART on Thursday morning, they were asked to get the child on Nov 24, despite being told about his critical condition. She said the child succumbed to his infection on Thursday afternoon. Blaming the ART for the child\u2019s death, Rinki said for the past one year the child was denied treatment despite follow ups with the authorities. She said this is not the first such case and claimed that seven other HIV patients have died due to the same reasons. When TOI contacted Dr Binjhwar, he denied the allegations and said, \u201cApparently there was some communication gap\u201d, Insisting that the child was not denied medication or treatment, Binjhwar said the child\u2019s relatives were asked to bring him to the ART on Thursday but they never came. When asked why the child was denied treatment for this long despite being referred to the ART for second line treatment over a year back, Binjhwar said the patient\u2019s report of viral load test, which was sent to Kolkata, had not been received so far. He said this report, which measures the number of HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood, is essential for deciding the correct dosage for the patient. However, Binjhwar admitted that medicines could have been provided to the child, under expert guidance, since he was in a critical condition."

Mahajan has years ago, had seven drug-eluting stents fitted in to his heart's arteries in two procedures carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday. Mahajan is possibly the only HIV-positive (human immunodeficiency virus) person who has had so many stents (medical devices made of special metal used to clear blockages in arteries) fitted at the Byculla hospital. \"He has known about his HIV status for years and has been under medication. When he came to us we found that he also has diabetes,\" said Dr N O Bansal, who heads the department of cardiology at JJ Hospital. The public hospital has been operating on HIV-positive persons for the last few years. \"Few hospitals are willing to operate on HIV-positive persons,\" said Dr Bansal. . In fact, JJ Hospital-a centre of excellence for HIV patients -has performed over 1,000 deliveries of mothers who are HIV-positive. While those who are HIV-positive are prone to heart-related ailmentssuch as coronary artery disease, Mahajan's case was more difficult than usual due to the extent of the disease. \"His arteries were thread-like and he had several blockages,'' said Dr Bansal. Mahajan was therefore advised a bypass surgery. \"While we understood that this might have been the best treatment for my heart problems, my family and friends wanted an angioplasty because it would involve no cuts,\" said Mahajan. His father told TOI that his co-conditions such as diabetes, could have made his recovery difficult. recovering a difficult process. But on Thursday, Mahajan said that his chest pain had disappeared. \"I hadn't eaten a meal since I suffered a heart attack on June 26.

Patients with complex heart disease, too can have a non-surgical option,'' said Dr Bansal. Doctors said that Mahajan was doing well. They said that although his heart's pumping capacity had reduced a great deal after the attack, it would improve significantly over the next six to eight weeks.

        "body": "BANGALORE: Their future might be uncertain and their past a cruel reality. But children at Snehadaan live their present with zest. Snehadaan, an NGO, is a second home for people with HIV. The centre, started in 1997, provides medical care, education, shelter and vocational training to the city's HIV-affected community. On Saturday, the centre organized a unique programme 'Champion In Me', in which HIV-positive kids from all over the state participated in singing and dance competitions. \"We are trying to give them a platform that will give them confidence and help them meet similar children who share their woes,\" says Fr Mathew Perumpil, who works with the centre. For Prithvi (name changed), 12, from Bangalore, Saturday was joyful. Dressed in a white fairy gown, she was waiting for her turn to dance. \"I was an orphan before I was brought to Snehadaan. There are many people who care for me now. I do miss my parents, though,\" says Prithvi. Satish (name changed), an 8-year-old singer from Belgaum, delivered his best at the contest. \"My teacher taught me the song. I live in a hostel,\" says the HIV-positive boy who lost his parents to AIDS. On the eve of World AIDS Day, Snehadaan, located on the outskirts of Bangalore, conducted a blood donation drive to help those living with HIV."

        "body": "MADURAI: Five-year-old Chittu (name changed), a UKG student, is today a bubbly girl who is the cynosure of all eyes at the Russ Foundation in Madurai, where she lives along with 10 other HIV positive parentless boys and girls. But her early childhood was one of hardship and there are many out in the community in want of attention. According to Berlin Jose, founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. \"We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,\" said Jose. Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. \"It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,\" he said. Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents. This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. \"This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,\" he said. Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future. Kumar, a boy who was expelled from a home for his mischief, is today a sturdy 18-year-old pursuing his SSLC at this home. He is also a caring brother to the smaller children; he wants to take up a career as a mechanical engineer. Selvam on the other hand who was brought to the home by his grandmother and aunt because his other relatives did not want him among them has no wish to study. But he is good with gadgets and wants to look after his grandmother and aunt well. On World AIDS Day, these children had a feast with 800 others to celebrate the occasion and look forward to life ahead. Jose says it is encouraging that the incidence of HIV/AIDS has come down in the state but added that the government should formulate a policy for the care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS. \"In no way should AIDS control programmes be relaxed because there are many who still have not been brought back into mainstream society,\" he adds."

Mahatar Sathi Jagriti Manch president Kimti Rawal claimed that the NGO was supporting the patient and her family. \"This incident has given rise to two issues: first, a doctor refused to operate on a HIV-positive patient and that is criminal for a doctor; and second, the doctor had alleged that the government was providing sub-standard kits to doctors. His allegation should be investigated into,\" Rawal said. Rawal said they had given a two-week ultimatum to the DC: \"If no decision is taken, we will approach the high court and seek justice.\" On April 30, a pregnant, HIV-positive woman was admitted to the civil hospital, but gynaecologist Dr Manjeet Bajwa had refused to carry out a C-section on the woman, alleging that surgery kits provided to doctors at the hospital were poor in quality. After pressure from higher-ups, Dr Bajwa had agreed to the pressure, but then backed out at the last minute, saying that he could not risk his life."

The World AIDS Day (December 1) brings together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and demonstrate international solidarity in the face of the pandemic. According to WHO, between 2011-2015, World AIDS Days will have the theme of 'Getting to zero: zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths'. According to the UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2012, in the last ten years, the landscape of national HIV epidemic has changed dramatically for the better in most countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, Nepal drastically reduced new HIV infections by 91%. Cambodia reduced new HIV infections by 88%. Four countries that account for a large number of people living with HIV in the region\u2014India, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Thailand\u2014reduced new HIV infections by more than 50%. Malaysia's new infections dropped by 34%. However, the epidemic significantly increased in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines and Sri Lanka."

        "body": "Hubballi: A woman in her mid-20s was shattered when she was declared HIV positive in a routine blood test conducted at a private laboratory in Haveri town, about 75km from here, early this week. For 72 hours, Kulsumbi was nervous and harboured thoughts of committing suicide. She was worried about her family of five young children and her spouse, a tiles labourer who earned very little. The family of Sayad Eqbal Ahmed Jamadar heaved a sigh of relief after a second medical test conducted three days later - at a government hospital - said she is in the clear. Sharing the trauma of those three days, Sayad Eqbal Ahmed Jamadar said his wife had a growth on her hand and a government doctor suggested she undergo a routine blood test to ascertain if she has any vitamin deficiency. The worried couple went to a private lab in Haveri on Monda. Thanks to a mix-up by the lab, the woman received a report that declared her HIV positive. The Jamadar family was too shocked to rush to another lab for a second test. \"I was traumatized and found it extremely difficult to convince my wife that we can seek a second opinion. She was depressed, spoke of committing suicide by hanging as she didn't want to live with the stigma of HIV. I made several attempts to keep hope,\" Sayad pointed out. That was when the couple decided to seek the counsel of family friend Khader. He suggested an immediate second test and reprimanded Jamadar's wife for contemplating suicide based on \"a random test\". Jamadar said: \"On Khader's advice, we went to the Haveri government hospital on Wednesday for a test, this time to rule out presence of HIV in her bloodstream. To our great relief, she tested negative for HIV. We are extremely happy, and equally angry with the private lab for the costly blooper.\" The family brought the issue to the district health officer's notice, seeking action against the lab. When Jamadar confronted laboratory officials, they admitted to the lapse and claimed a faulty medical kit would have thrown the HIV result in a routine blood test. He is contemplating filing a case against the lab. Haveri district surgeon Mahesh Badni blamed the lab for the horrendous mix-up. District health officer Sunil Chandra Avaradi held the lab responsible for the goof-up, and said no hospital or medical facility informs a patient of HIV test results. He said his department will conduct a probe into the incident and punish the guilty. A technician from the Haveri lab who didn't wish to be identified apologized for the mistake."

Main speaker Dr Preeti Pathak laid emphasis on creating HIV and AIDS awareness from home. She said that children would be under risk category till parents were ready to discuss AIDS with their children on dining table. \"The number of AIDS patients is multiplying every year. The country has a large number of persons afflicted with HIV/AIDS. The country manufactures most of the drugs used to cure HIV around the world yet due to high cost, 50% of patients in India lack access to them. Hence education and awareness can be the only remedy,\" added Preeti. Addressing the conference, DM, Sameer Verma said that as there is no proper medical treatment for this deadly disease, awareness is the only 'Mantra' and hence awareness should be reach to all horizons of the society. Sharing information about HIV and AIDS, District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO) Dr AK Saxena said that AIDS was the biggest challenge. Most of the patients belonged to the productive age group of 15 to 49 years. He added that the disease was spreading at an alarming pace in the country and as per the recent figures around 62 lakh patients were suffering from the disease and the number was continuously increasing. \"The effort will succeed only when all organizations participate in this endeavor. Awareness is the only precaution and the government must work to create awareness,\" said the CMO. CDO Rajendra Singh Yadav said that he would organize AIDS and HIV awareness workshop in villages and take the message to all sections of the society. AIDS counsellors Ritu Singh, Krati, Mahendra and Amit were also present during the workshop."

When under the influence of alcohol, one can turn into a beast, thus ruining his own life and the precious life of others. This is the message conveyed by comedian Ambe in his drama 'Dhanvta To Ghoddo'. Nisha (Nancy Gomes) is left disheartened after her lover passes away. She tries to cope with life, despite her immense grief and pain. While trying to overcome her sorrow in the garden, Rocky (Jose) confronts Nisha along with two of his goons. He is impressed by Nisha's appearance and tries to win her confidence forcefully. But like a good samaritan, Sandra (Evon) comes to Nisha's rescue and succeeds in saving the hapless girl from the clutches of the hungry goons. Confronted by strangers, Nisha fears that those goons may attack her on her return home. Sandra goes a step forward and decides to take Nisha to her house. But little does Nisha realize that she will encounter the worst at Sandra's residence. As she makes efforts to make her comfortable there, Sandra's brother-in-law Zico Gonsalves (Franky) drops in drunk. In his intoxicated state, he rapes Nisha without a second thought. Sandra, who appears on the scene a little later, does not react. Instead, she is happy with the development as she is aware that her brother-in-law is a beast when under the influence of alcohol. Nisha resolves to marry Zico, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend. Why does Nisha take such a decision and does she succeed in fulfilling her promise? How does Sandra react to the entire situation? What is its outcome? Nancy Gomes has given her best performance as an AIDS victim. Franky excels in his character of an alcoholic. Justin wins the sympathy of the audience in his role as Nisha's father. Comic interludes by Ambe, Aurelio and Agnelo provide a laughter riot, but some of them could have been toned down. Songs rendered by Menino Mario (Sobhav), Jose/Evon (Noxibak Roddonaka), Cajie (Adim ani Atam), Jose (Padrik Okman) are appealing. Although the singers were ably supported with live music throughout the show, the wind instruments went amiss. The director could have paid better attention to stage setting to enhance the drama. Introduction of two amateur artistes Agnelo (comedian) and Cajetan de Cacoda (singer) have paved way for the growth and future of tiatr."

The place where she celebrated the birthday was not a hotel but a care home for children living with HIV/AIDS. The building was constructed with funds Malzner raised over the past five years from Austria to give a permanent residence to 40-odd children, who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS. These children have been living rented homes for the past 12 years and forced to shift at least 15 times. The birthday celebration was made special as the new building for the care home was inaugurated on the same day. \u201cI will never forget this birthday,\u201d Malzner told ToI. Malzner raised 60,000 Euros on her own and persuaded an organisation called Karibu World, which chipped in with 60,000 Euros for the care home. \u201cI raised 60,000 Euros and Karibu World also contributed an equal amount. Since Karibu World receives funds from the Austrian government, we can say that the government too helped in the construction of the building,\u201d she said. It was a challenging task for Malzner to raise funds in her country. \u201cI faced problems initially. But then I showed them my presentation, why I was doing it and they developed trust in me,\u201d said Malzner. Malzner has a restaurant and also a shop in Hirschbach Im M\u00fchlkreis, Oberosterreich, Austria. She also had many friends in the restaurant business. On her request, they agreed to donate amounts ranging from one Euro to five Euros per soup sold at theier establishments to Malzner. \u201cI also sold scarfs in Austria which I took from India. The margin I got was donated to for the cause. I also organised parties, including dance events and food festivals, and asked participants to contribute,\u201d Malzner said. She had first come to Jaipur in 2013 as a volunteer with an organisation to teach English to children in Katputli Nagar. \u201cI came here in 2013 to do some community work for four weeks. It was not my aim to construct a building for such children. But, after spending four weeks in Kotpulti Nagar, I wanted to do more good work. So, I decided to work for these children,\u201d said Malzner said, dressed in an Indian saree. \u201cThe child welfare committee (CWC) has inspected the house and given permission for shifting the children,\u201d said CWC member Nisha Pareek. The children are being taken care of by the NGO, Aashray Care Home. \u201cOur organisation was registered in 2006. Since then, we had to shift from at least 15 homes. It was difficult for us to get homes on rent for HIV children,\u201d said, Sushila Mordiya, superintendent Aashray Care Home."

The Centre had serious reservations in taking on HIV positive persons who had been irrationally treated by private hospitals for second-line treatment but it bowed to the SC\u2019s argument that the government could not discriminate in extending medical facilities when the core question was right to life. Senior advocate T S Doabia, appearing for the health ministry, informed a Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that National AIDS Control Organisation has decided to extend second-line ART to all HIV positive patients at four centres of excellence in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. \u201cThis facility will gradually extended to all 10 such centres in pahses,\u201d he said, adding that this experiment would continue for a period of three months. While first-line ART costs Rs 6,500 per year for each patient, the second line is more than four times costlier at Rs 28,500.

Her end came without being operated on and being transfused blood. The woman's relatives had told TOI on Friday that the doctors had refused to operate on her since she was HIV positive. According to her son Babloo, she was taken to emergency from the ward around 11am when there was almost no movement in her. \"We were once told that she has been taken to operation theatre, but the surgery was not performed. Ultimately, at around 3pm, she died.\" PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said the fast deteriorating condition of woman led to her death. Dr J P Gupta, who was treating the woman, could not be contacted after her death. Earlier in the day, Dr Gupta had said the woman did not require an operation. He added the patient was experiencing difficulty in breathing and needed blood transfusion, but her attendants couldn't arrange blood. Babloo said he visited the blood bank many times since Sunday to give replacement blood but could succeed in doing so only on Monday morning. Then too, he could not get blood for her mother. This happened despite a clear order of the health department not to ask for replacement blood from HIV positive people. The PMCH doctors had maintained till Sunday that she had undergone laparotomy (a surgical procedure of abdominal cavity) sometime back, hence she couldn't be operated and was being kept under observation. However, Babloo said on Monday, \"She had not undergone any surgery for the last five years. From denying blood to delaying surgery, it was a conspiracy to buy time and wait for the eventuality.\" No post-mortem was performed on her. Some doctors aware of the case said on the condition of anonymity that the surgery might have been risky, but the risk should have been taken. Gyan Ranjan, a member of the governing council of Bihar State AIDS Control Society, said this was not a solitary case of its kind. At least three other HIV positive people had faced similar treatment in the recent months, he said."

Delhi grabbed the fourth position with 264 cases.Maharashtra has recorded more than 1,239 such cases over the last six years. While activists are alarmed with the findings, NACO insisted that the data is not a real indicator as it is based on voluntary disclosure by clients at the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC).A senior NACO official told TOI, \u201cThe numbers are self-reported. It's not corroborated further by following up with blood tests. The overall situation is actually much better now. In 1999, transfusion transmitted HIV was 15%, which has now come down to less than 1%.\u201c The official added that the issue of safe blood can be best addressed with an Act that most developed nations have.The Maharashtra State Aids Control Society said that most clients at the ICTC give a history of blood transfusion even if they have indulged in unsafe sex or injecting drugs.\u201cThe fact is that at least 90% of HIV transmissions still occur through sexual intercourse,\u201c said Dr Shobhna Tehra, joint director of the society .A doctor, who has been crusading for safe blood, said that the government has not showed any urgency to bring in advanced tests, such as nuclear acid testing, that cut down the HIV detection window period to six days from three months. \u201cThey are risking the life of poor patients. The worst hit are thalassemia patients who have to take regular transfusions,\u201c said RTI activist Chetan Kothari.Tehra said that the department is working on a proposal for NAT in NACOsupported blood banks in Maharashtra. India reported 2,234 cases of HIV infection spread through blood transfusion between October 2014 and March 2016 and this amounts to less than 1% of the total number of cases, the government has said.National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and the health ministry said in 2009-10 India reported 2,711 such cases and the number of people affected with HIV due to blood transfusion have reduced drastically over the past 15 years tho ugh the government con tinues to aim for zero transmission.The government's at tempt to place the numbers in context came after NACO provided the statistics to an RTI query , which said 2,234 persons were infected with HIV while receiving blood transfusions in the 17 months under review.Officials also said the data is \u201cnot scientific\u201c as it is based on subjective responses received from people visiting for HIV testing. \u201cThere are several occasions when patients do not declare the exact reason or means of transmission because of societal pressure or even lack of awareness.Therefore, the data cannot be considered 100% accurate,\u201c a senior official at NACO said.However, the government maintained it is also working towards stringent blood safety screening and to introduce technologies to ensure zero transmission. In India, NACO has been primarily responsible for ensuring transfer of safe blood.According to the 2015 annual report, till September 2014, NACO's total blood collection was around 30 lakh units. The total number of people living with HIV in India was estimated at around 20.9 lakh in 2011. Nearly 86% of these patients are in the 15-49 age-group. Children less than 15 years of age accounted for 1.45 lakh of all infections in 2011 while 39% were among women."

        "body": "RANCHI: A state level data compiled by the Jharkhand State Aids Control Society (JSACS) reveals four in every 100 new HIV positive cases are pregnant women. Fifty pregnant women were tested HIV positive in the government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) from April to October this year. Around 1,076 positive cases were found during this period. The number, which JSACS officials believe is only 'the tip of the iceberg', adds to the ever rising HIV cases. As per a National Aids Control Organization (NACO) estimate of 2015, the HIV infections among pregnant women recorded a near three-fold jump from 2010. Around 320 children, including 227 newborns, contracted HIV in their mother's wombs or at later stages. In 2012-13, 235 children, 150 infants, were reported to be HIV positive. Despite Jharkhand being ranked low in HIV cases among children in comparison to Bihar and Odisha, JSACS has reasons to be worried now with the latest data surpassing the records of infected 56 mother-baby pairs of 2013-2014 (56were found to be HIV) and 2012-2013 (36 were found). Though no state level survey on HIV infected children (below 15 years) is available), JSACS estimate say that the number could be anywhere around 3,000. Explaining the steady growth in number, JSACS said most of the women, JSACS said, come from the industrial areas and districts where migration for employment is high. \"However, the numbers can be higher because many of the men who contract the disease outside Jharkhand refuse to get themselves screened. These men in turn transmit the disease to the women,\" a JSACS official said. Approximately 25,000 people are living with HIV in Jharkhand. Dr BB Poddar, additional project director JSACS said the \"timely interventions and awareness campaigns are underway across the state and mining areas and amid truckers\"."

        "body": "KOCHI: Two fresh AIDS cases have been reported among migrant workers this year\u2013one each from Perumbavoor and Kochi city during medical camps organized for the migrants across the district. Last year, no new cases of the immune deficiency syndrome were identified among those tested. There are 1,691 HIV positive people in Ernakulam as against a total of 26,242 in the state. The men, who are natives of Assam and Bihar, belong to high-risk groups and have lived in other metro cities before coming to Kerala, said NGOs who are monitoring them. It is learnt that the man from Assam has already left the state but he is in touch with NGO staff working in the area. Sapna Raj who is the project manager of Suraksha, a sexual health programme of KSACS, works with migrant groups in Perumbavoor to monitor the prevalence of AIDS said the organization has tied up with local industries to help organize awareness classes. \"There is an issue of social stigma associated with AIDS. So we gradually bring the person into our system by keeping constant touch with them over phone. We make sure that they don\u2019t disappear and get lost in the crowd,\" she said. However, there are instances in which individuals themselves reveal their HIV status. In one case, an employee working with a textile shop showed his blood report result to a colleague, leading to his removal from the job. Depressed, the man just vanished. We don\u2019t know where he is now,\" said another NGO worker. Perumbavoor, which has a large population of domestic migrants, is under the scanner of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS) owing to the rising number of men from West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Assam who live together in the area. As many as 10 people shack up in a single living unit. Many are yet to bring in their families. Their lack of hygiene is also a cause for concern. They too are monitored under Suraksha. Apart from intravenous drug users, two new groups \u2014 transgenders and truckers \u2013 are also being tested at several camps, officials said. \"We have made the facility of a doctor available in these camps. The truckers are being tested at Palakkad and Ernakulam,\" said Binu George, project officer, technical support unit, Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS). Officials said it was difficult to identify transgenders as they stay hidden because of social stigma."

        "body": "LONDON: In landmark legislation, kits allowing people to test themselves for HIV at home can be bought over the counter in the UK for the first time. The new law that came into force on Sunday makes it legal for Britons to test and diagnose themselves at home. The move is expected to help 25,000 undiagnosed HIV-positive people know their status. There is, however, one small glitch - no OTC HIV testing kit is sold in the UK at present. Experts expect the kits to be available in the market by 2015. The US FDA approved the first OTC HIV test kit that allows people to test at home in 2012. The OraQuick In-Home HIV test is designed to allows individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes. One in four people living with HIV in England is currently unaware of his or her infection in England, contributing to ongoing transmission in the population and poorer health outcomes for those individuals. Anthony Nardone, consultant epidemiologist in Public Health England (PHE's) HIV/STI department, said: \"People who are unaware of their infection are likely to be those most at risk of transmitting HIV to others. By encouraging earlier and more frequent HIV testing, we can accelerate a reduction in the number of people with undiagnosed HIV infection in the UK. We hope this new resource will help people decide to test for HIV in the way that best suits them.\" In August 2013, the department of health had announced plans to repeal the UK ban on the sale of HIV self-testing kits"

        "body": "NEW DELHI: After a condom shortage, India's fight against AIDS faces a fresh challenge with thousands of health workers involved in programmes to control HIV being either laid off or not receiving salaries for several months. Health workers in states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat are bearing the brunt of the lay offs while the problem is also affecting AIDS control in Delhi, Uttarakhand and Haryana. Almost 6,000 AIDS health workers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have not received salaries for 10 months, whereas State AIDS Control Society in Maharashtra and Gujarat recently directed NGOs to curtail outreach workers by 25% and peer educators by 80%. States are blaming lack of funds of the lay offs while activists are questioning the Centre's lack of will in supporting the programme. Senior health ministry officials acknowledge the problem but point out that Rs 274 crore has been released to states in 2015-16 of which only eight states have used the funds. \"There is a lack of will within the government. Laying off of health workers is not only impacting the personnel but can be dangerous for the whole programme because these are the people who work on ground,\" says Mona Mishra, a public health expert and a social activist, who works closely with many targeted intervention groups. READ ALSO: HIV fears rise over condom shortage in states Global funding dips by 90%, may cripple war on AIDS While the lack of coordination between the Centre and states is obvious, a health ministry official said \"We are aware of the problem and therefore have written to state finance secretaries. The ministry will also soon take it up with chief secretaries.\" The impact of health workers not receiving salaries is likely to be significant as these outreach workers and educators are the ones who implement the programme on ground by creating awareness, mobilizing sex workers, transgenders and other vulnerable populations for HIV testing and treatment. These health workers are also involved in distribution of condoms and medicines. Public health experts warn laying off health workers can cripple the program and even reverse the gains of previous efforts to control the AIDS epidemic. Experts blame the lack of coordination between the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which works under the Union health ministry, and states for delay in payments, coupled with lack of enough budgetary support and uncertainty in devolution of funds between the state and the Centre. Experts are also concerned that many of the workers who come from vulnerable communities and were trained in awareness and health programmes might slip back into risky professions. \"Many of these workers moved out of sex work and some transgenders gave up begging to help the programme. Laying off such people would mean interrupting their rehabilitation and sending them back to their old jobs again,\" says Nochiketa Mohanty, Country Program Manager, AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The national AIDS control programme is the government's largest health intervention programme. The programme run under NACO and implemented by states demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, India still continues to have the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world. Not only public health experts, even senior officials in the government as well as international agencies say this is a very crucial phase and problems at this stage can offset the achievements so far. \"There is an urgent need to carry on the momentum and this certainly is not the time to sit back,\" the health ministry official said. Apart from budgetary constraints and uncertainty created by devolution of funds between the Centre and the state, the AIDS control programme has also witnessed a huge reduction in funding from various multilateral, bilateral and philanthropic donor organisations over the last three years."

The state capital is far behind Sitamarhi, with only 76.9% married women being aware, thereby gaining the fifth position in the list.

Inaugurating the exhibition, Modi said, \"People with HIV/Aids should not be shy of talking about their disease. They should come forward and avail the treatment being offered. There is an urgent need to create awareness about disease and remove the social stigma attached with it. Safe sex should be encouraged as a large number of people, who migrate to other places, get affected with the disease.\" He advised people to donate blood and also fetch it only from 64 blood banks recognized by the state government.

To prevent this transmission, the State Aids Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh, has started providing free milk powder to the HIV-positive mothers until the child is six months. It is expected to benefit around 100 such women. Out of the 1,176 registered positives in the city, 200 are women of reproductive age. SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta says, \u201cBreastfeeding can transmit the virus to a child. We advise continuity of whatever milk a child is on. In case, a positive mother is unable to continue feeding the infant before it turns six months and makes it drink processed one, it develops infection.\u201d \u201cThe mothers need not bother about how to sustain the life of their young one as the free supply will continue until the baby turns six months. At the time of anti-retroviral therapy, we screen out expectant mothers who can avail this scheme from their nearest integrated counselling and testing centres,?\u201dshe adds. The SACS has roped in a few NGOs to manage finances for the purpose. It is only after a doctor clinically decides the criteria of which patient can breastfeed, the milk tin is given, states Dr Archana Mohan of SACS. HIV can spread from a mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When milk powder feed is followed by breastfeed, the lining of the baby\u2019s intestine is destroyed. This makes it susceptible to HIV, warns Dr Vanita. Most of the positives are unable to afford this nutrient. The virus disables them to work and earn livelihood. This small initiative can make some difference for them. Recently, three mothers have received the benefit of the scheme, said Pooja Thakur, president of the People living with HIV/AIDS."

        "title": "Doctors delaying treatment to HIV patients, claims NGO",
        "body": "Mysuru: \u2018Right to Health\u2019 is the theme for the 2017 World Aids Day, which falls on December 1. However, some people living with HIV in Mysuru feel stigmatized as people in the medical profession themselves are looking at them as \u2018aliens\u2019 by delaying treatment. Sources in Ananda Jyothi Positive Network, an organization of positive people working for the welfare of community members, claimed that doctors are avoiding treating HIV patients. They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients. The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said. Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. \u201cThey also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn\u2019t treat them. We have intervened and in talks with authorities concerned to get them treatment,\u201d she added. Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add. AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. \u201cNo one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,\u201d she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. \u201cMoreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is \u2018willful\u2019 delay or not,\u201d she said. Stats: ** A total of 18,175 persons have been affected with HIV in Mysuru district. Of them 14,470 are registered with the ART centre at KR Hospital, 2,624 with Asha Kirana Hospital and 1,081 with JSS hospital. ** HIV prevalence is 0.7 % in Mysuru. Of the 1.38 lakh people including 44,811 pregnant women who were tested in 2016-17, 951 people and 33 pregnant women were found to be HIV positive. This year, the figures stand at 580 and 24 respectively. ** Mysuru has 24 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres and one Mobile ICTC centre. ** Mysuru has 3 ART centres - KR hospital, Ashakirana and JSS hospital ** 9 Link ART Centres: Nanjangud, Hunsur, T Narasipura, Periyapatna, KR Nagara and HD Kote public health centres, Bannur community health centre, SVYM, Sargur and Ananda Jyothi Positive Network Link ARTs ** As many as 30 children were infected through their mothers between 2010 and October 2017. ** As many as 3,012 female sex workers and 1,821 male sex workers are being educated continually by an NGO Ashodaya under targeted intervention programme ** As many as 68 red ribbon clubs have been formed in degree colleges to create awareness about HIV. Students in 28 high schools are also being educated about HIV. ** Free blood: The district has 11 blood banks and blood donation camps in association with KR Hospital, JSS Hospital, Jeevadhara Blood Bank, Rotary, and Chandrakala Hospital, where HIV positive persons can get free blood. ** Shortage of blood: Though two pints of blood have to be given free of cost to HIV patients, but of late only one pint is given and they are charged for the second unit. (No attribute or source given) HIV helpline number: 1097 Housing scheme yet to catch up in district Ananda Jyothi Positive Network facilitates HIV people to get facilities like treatment, pension, nutritious food, blood and other benefits. It has received 372 applications from HIV patients under a government housing scheme. While houses have been provided under a group housing scheme in Bengaluru and Chamarajanagar, it is yet to be realized in Mysuru."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The government is eyeing Guinness Book of Records on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s 66th birthday this Saturday. In a major initiative in his home state Gujarat, Modi would distribute assistive aids and appliances in Navsari to 11,000 differently-abled persons \u2013 the highest ever number in the world. In the run-up to the grand ceremony, the government is eyeing three more Guinness records on the eve. These include 1,000 oil lamps lit by differently-abled at one time, a formation by 1,000 wheelchair-bound persons and distribution of hearing aid to 1,000 beneficiaries. Lighting 1,000 oil lamps by differently-abled would be the first such attempt in the world. So far, the record of a formation by wheelchair-bound persons is held in US by 346 differentlyabled. India would try and break the record held in Australia when 500 persons were given hearing aids. Speaking to ET, department of empowerment of persons with disabilities joint secretary Awanish Kumar Awasthi said, \u201cWe are attempting this record ceremony to bring awareness and change the mindset of the people.We have conducted three surveys to get over 11,000 beneficiaries in this area.\u201d The department worked closely with the district administration headed by collector Ravi Arora, who is himself differently-abled. Modi, alongwith social justice and empowerment minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot and area BJP MP C R Patil, would be giving tricycles, wheelchairs, cerebral palsy chair, multi sensory integrated educational development (MSIED) kit, calipers and prosthesis and loan cheques to 11,223 beneciaries in Navsari. The government would distribute assistive aids worth Rs 7.5 crore. The government had missed the record in January earlier this year in Prime Minister\u2019s constituency Varanasi. Even then assistive aids and appliances had been distributed to 10,200 beneficiaries but the Guinness Book of Records officials had raised some objections on the way videography was done. This time the government is not taking any chances. The event would be videographed properly and Guinness observers from UK would be watching and counting closely."

        "body": "NAGPUR: As many as 2,223 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive cases have been detected in Nagpur district in the first seven months (January 1 to July 31) of this year. This figure includes 154 pregnant women. Notably, it is only those patients who reported at government centres. There could be several more undetected HIV+ve cases in the district. According to resident deputy collector Pramod Bhusari, these cases were found at 19 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) situated in the district. Bhusari revealed this while briefing reporters on International Youth Day celebrations to be held on August 12. He said a rally would be organised to create awareness about HIV among youngsters and to make district HIV free. \"It is duty of every student to create awareness about HIV among rural women, as they are more vulnerable to the killer disease,\" he said. Bhusari said that during January 1 to July 31, blood samples of 41,451 persons were tested for HIV in the district. Of these, 2079 persons were found HIV positive. Similarly, blood samples of 35,901 pregnant women were examined. Of these, 154 were found HIV positive. He said the district health administration has given target to test blood samples of 82,000 persons while 65,000 ante-natal cases are to be examined. Strangely, the health department has no figures of patients' dying of AIDS. The persons whose blood samples are tested include pregnant women, TB patients, sexual disease cases and suspected HIV cases referred by doctors from various hospitals. Bhusari urged people to avoid unsafe sex, used syringes, and transfusion of blood from professional donors as these are main ways of transmission of HIV. He also urged barbers to use new blades for each customer."

He had suffered multiple fractures in his right leg. The doctors started the treatment but after knowing that he was a HIV patient, they allegedly left him alone on the operation table. His pain was unbearable but no doctor was allegedly ready to treat him. \u201cWe were told to leave the hospital and seek treatment from other hospital. We took our patient to a private hospital where, thankfully, the doctors treated Raj Kumar. He is better now,\u201d one of Kumar\u2019s relatives said. Similar was the case of Mahinder Singh (name changed), who was denied admission in LLR Hospital on Saturday. According to the patient\u2019s kin, he was taken to LLR Hospital\u2019s medicine department in a serious condition. But, when the hospital staff denied admission, they took him to ART Centre which is meant to treat and rehabilitate HIV positive or AIDS patients. They added that Singh was spotted by a NGO van and was lucky enough to get proper treatment by the doctors working for the NGO. Contacted, director of Ursula Hospital Dr R Saxena said, \u201cThe hospital lacks special medicines that are recommended to HIV patients. HIV positive patients are given much stronger medicines which are different from the regular drugs. These medicines are not available in every hospital. Government provides these drugs to LLR Hospital, so we refer such patients to that hospital. Raj Kumar was also referred to LLR Hospital and it was his choice to seek help from a private hospital.\u201d When contacted for comments, head, department of medicine at the LLR Hospital Dr Aarti Lalchandani said that she was unaware about the case. \u201cNo one contacted me about this case. Moreover, we have certain limitations. There is a process of admission and we cannot admit every other patient coming to us. He must have some other problem, probably out of the area of medicine department because of which he was left untreated. HIV patients are mostly referred to cardiology, cancer or TB hospital,\u201d she said. When asked as to why HIV patients are not given proper care and attention, the doctor clarified that they do provide good care to these patients. \u201cWe have all the facilities in our hospital. We give them strong medicines and give them proper attention. We don\u2019t do surgeries in cases where there is no hope,\u201d she said."

        "body": "RAIPUR: In a case of discrimination against HIV patients, staff of Dr BR Ambedkar Hospital here put up a hand written notice of \u2018universal precautions\u2019 on the bedside of a HIV positive women and her newly born child, who has not been confirmed to be suffering from the disease. The woman (identity withheld), who delivered the child on July 2, was shocked to find the notice put up by her bedside and the cradle for the baby in a ward (No. 4), which had 24 other women. The humiliation of the couple did not end with just the notice, as the staff kept addressing the women as \u2018HIV walli\u2019 instead of her name. Recounting what he termed as humiliating days, the husband said while the staff in the ward addressed all the women with their first names, his wife was called \u2018HIV walli\u2019. He said his requests to the staff to refrain from doing so made no difference and they were made to feel like outcastes in the ward. Though at present there are no comprehensive laws in India to deal with such discrimination with HIV/AIDS infected people and their rights, India is signatory to various international treaties and agreements that provide for protection against such non-discrimination. A leading lawyer pointed out that Bombay High court had ruled that the court would permit HIV positive litigant to conceal his or her identity and prosecute or defend the proceedings under an assumed name. \u201cWhen the law is clear, then why isn\u2019t it followed in the hospital,\u201d questioned Rinki Arora, president of Chhattisgarh Network of Positive. Admitting that it could be in the interest of the staff to know that an individual is a HIV patient, Rinki said the status of the individual could be mentioned on their health sheets and the prescriptions rather than publically declaring her status. \u201cThe hospital staff has already branded the child HIV positive with the poster on the side of the cradle,\u201d she added. Advocacy officer of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion trust, Amruta Alpesh Soni, who also visited the hospital, said the hospital had violated NACO guidelines. When contacted, hospital\u2019s public relation officer, Shubhra said the staff put up the notice to make duty nurses aware of the patient\u2019s status. She, however, admitted that it was wrong to address the patient by her HIV status and the administration would look into it."

Meena, however, never knew when she got inflicted with the deadly HIV. Her husband Dinesh (name changed) had returned home with HIV and the couple has now lost all hopes of survival. This is not the only case. Despite numerous awareness programmes, AIDS is spreading its tentacles in the hill state as well. While a total of 5,700 people here are known to be HIV positive, 429 have succumbed to AIDS according to government records. \"These are the cases that have been reported from across the state between 2002 and 2013. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of more such cases which have not been reported yet,\" Additional Project Director, Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society (USACS), Dr Meenakshi Uniyal, said. According to reports, nearly 70% of the transmission in the state was through unhygienic and multiple sexual relations. \"One of the reasons for the rising number of HIV positive cases in the state is increase in the migration of people to neighbouring states for employment. Use of injectable drugs is another reason. The number is also increasing because of increasing awareness and more people getting tested for HIV voluntarily,\" Joint Director, Information Education and Communication (IEC), USACS, Uma Prashad explained. Statistics indicate that above 90% of the affected people in the state were those who had migrated in search of jobs to other states. According to government records, a total of 3,500 HIV positive people in the state are presently registered at various Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres and a total of 1,810 are taking free of cost treatment for the ailment. Close to 40 NGOs are currently working in the field of HIV/AIDS in the hill state. Four districts \u2014Dehradun, Haridwar, Uddham Singh Nagar and Nainital\u2014have already been declared as HIV 'sensitive'. Officials added that a large number of the reported HIV/AIDS cases in the state are that of pregnant women. \"A total of 22 pregnant women in the state have been found HIV positive this year alone. The deadly virus in most of these cases came from their HIV positive husbands, who had migrated to other states for employment,\" Uniyal added. In view of increasing number of HIV positive cases amongst drug addicts, particularly students and adolescents, the state government has set up five Oral Supplement Therapy (OST) centres, which offer free counselling and medicines to people addicted to drugs."

He has also called a meeting of officials in UPSACS next week. \u201cThis is the second incident in the past year where we realized counselling has not been enough,\u201c Kumar told TOI.

Experts associated with National Aids Control Programme second that. \u201cThe process will have to recognize that there is a psychological aspect to the condition. Also, the affected individual is a part of the system which needs to understand the nuances of the responsibility,\u201c said Prof AK Tripathi, head of clinical haematology department, KGMU, supervising the university's Anti Retro Viral Therapy Center. There are over 400 ART centres which run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centers. Talking about the psychological dimension, founder UP Welfare for Persons Living with HIVAIDS society and HIV issues trainer, Naresh Yadav said, \u201cI often ask people in workshops as to which part of body is first attacked by HIV... no one says `mind or brain'. The counselling process also misses on the account.\u201c Offering a solution, project lead of PLHIV empowerment programme, Vimlesh Kumar, said, \u201cIt's time to expand the range of peer counselling (wherein a positive person breaks the news and supports the newly diagnosed person).\u201c Kumar believes that seeing someone like oneself leading a normal life may mitigate denial, depression and stigma."

        "body": "COIMBATORE: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has said that HIV-positive individuals cannot be denied insurance cover, unless supported by actuarial studies. The regulator has asked insurers to stop discriminating against persons with HIV/AIDS. IRDAI has made this mandatory after 'The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (Prevention and control) Act, 2017' came into force from September 10. The Act bars insurance companies from discriminating against HIV-positive individuals. However, most insurance companies have stayed away from launching products for HIV/AIDS patients due to pricing-related issues. \"If the immunity is low due to a person being HIV-positive, treatment expenses go up several times. The cost of tests and duration of stay in the hospital for HIV-positive patients would be much more compared to regular patients. That is why insurance companies are wary about offering cover for persons with compromised immunity,\" a senior industry official said. New India Assurance Company CMD G Srinivasan said, \"The problem is that insurers do not have enough data to design a cover for HIV-positive patients. We can offer coverage for early-stage HIV-positive patients with certain caveats and conditions.\" Star Health Insurance was the first company in the country to come out with an exclusive policy for such patients on a group basis. The 'Star Netplus Insurance Plan' is a special policy catering to HIV positive patients."

        "body": "MUMBAI: A 65-year-old cancer patient, Lilabihari Thakur (left), died and two others were injured in Bombay Hospital on Monday morning when an HIV-positive TB patient attacked them with a metal saline bottle stand, apparently without provocation. The attacker, a 42-year-old Agripada resident (name withheld by TOI), was subdued by ward boys and relatives of other patients in the third-floor general ward and handed over to the police. Dean T P Lahane said he seemed to display symptoms of schizophrenia. He has been admitted to a ward in JJ hospital, and his arms bound, said sources. He has been charged with murder, but is yet to be arrested. Police said around 6.30am, he came out of the toilet and attacked Thakur, whose lung cancer was in an advanced stage, but who was to be discharged in three days after a month\u2019s stay in the hospital. \u201cBy the time, ward boys and patients\u2019 relatives could stop him, he had smashed Thakur\u2019s head,\u201d said a source. Thakur was rushed to the hospital ICU, where he was pronounced dead after three hours. The Agripada resident also attacked two other patients\u2014Praful Parmar (70) and Janardhan Arte (66)\u2014who are in a stable condition. Thakur\u2019s son Pankaj said his mother Miradevi had been at his father\u2019s bedside since he was admitted on April 12. \u201cOn Monday morning, my mother had gone downstairs to bring medicines. The attack took place around that time. He hit father thrice with the rod, hurting his head. My father was bleeding profusely,\u201d said Pankaj, who works in a private firm as administrator. \u201cHe had hit the other two patients on their heads too,\u201d he added. The police said the people at the ward struggled to overpower the man. \u201cHe was so violent three to four men could not control him. Sister Alina Anthony, the nurse who is the complainant, said he was finally pinned down to a chair by several people, given a sedative injection and tied up,\u201d said a policeman. The accused was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis meningitis at Bombay Hospital since May 8. \u201cHe is a known case of tuberculosis and HIV, and had been admitted here even last year with similar health complaints,\u201d said Dr Sagar Sankhle, Bombay Hospital spokesperson. The accused had been cooperating with all diagnostic tests and had never showed any violent behaviour until Monday, he added. The accused used to work in a private firm until he was diagnosed with HIV. He then went into depression and was under treatment at several places before coming to the Marine Lines hospital, said the police. There was no enmity between the accused and Thakur, who came from Agra and worked as a taxi driver in Mumbai for over 30 years, or planning in the attack, said senior inspector Narendra Singh. Thakur, a resident of Pratiksha Nagar in Sion, is survived by his wife, three sons and two sisters. He needed regular clearing of lungs for fluid retention and was first admitted to the general ward. His health deteriorated and he was shifted to the ICU. \u201cOn April 30, he was brought back to the general ward. We were happy he was recovering and hoping to go home soon,\u201d added Pankaj."

        "body": "KANPUR: The University Institute of Paramedical Sciences, Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University, organised a voluntary blood donation camp and a seminar on AIDS awareness for the faculty members of the university and the paramedical staff working in different hospitals on Friday.

Priyadarshi said mainly because of blood transfusion, a person comes in contact with HIV. A total of 90-95% of people get affected with HIV due to blood transfusion. He added that HIV attacks CD 4 cells of the human body and weakens the immunity of the person. The person is unable to fight with the diseases and becomes seriously ill. World AIDS Day is being observed across the globe since 1988. The purpose of observing this day is to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. Dr Kiran Pandey, HoD, gynecology, GSVM Medical College said fairer sex is more prone to HIV/AIDS due to the physical structure. Lack of awareness among women is a cause of spread of AIDS.

        "body": "KENDRAPARA: Orissa's health department has begun a probe after a man was wrongly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS by a self-styled physician in a village here, officials said on Tuesday. Balaram Patra, 33, from the far-flung seaside Talchua village, who was later tested negative in the government-run diagnostic centre, has drawn the attention of police and health authorities to the issue. Health authorities have ordered a departmental probe into the incident, while an FIR has been lodged against the diagnostic centre and the self-styled doctor, officials said. The unsavoury episode lends credence to the oft-repeated charge that quacks are running parallel health service network in this coastal district. \"My life had taken a turn towards the worse after an erroneous medical report found me carrying HIV/AIDS virus. The government-run public health centre (PHC) at Talchua has become defunct and no doctor is turning up here,\" Patra, a local businessman, said. \"When I was suffering from fever and pain in the joints last month, I sought medical advice from a self-styled doctor who has opened a clinic in the village. He tested blood samples and to my horror, I was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS,\" he said. To crosscheck the blood-test results, Patra got himself tested at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Pattamundai run by state AIDS Control Society. \"Its an unfortunate incident. The diagnostic test report compiled by ICTC conclusively stated that the complainant was never infected with HIV virus,\" said Biraj Kumar Sahu, the chief district medical officer."

        "body": "MUMBAI: When World AIDS Day is observed across the globe on December 1, India will enter the third, and perhaps the most perplexing decade of its HIVAIDS epidemic. The first 29 years were marked with victory as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) metamorphosed from being the deadliest word in public health to just another chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension. that can be managed well with medicines. But experts warn that complacency, accompanied by a sharp drop in funding, could prove to be costly for India. Consider Mumbai for instance. HIV among the city's general population fell from 3.6% in 2013-14 to 3% in 2014-15.But the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) that manages health programmes for HIV+ AIDS people has been managing with a third of its annual budget of Rs 25 crore. \"Medicines have had a marvellous effect on the HIVAIDS epidemic so far. Every patient who has managed to get these medicines has not done poorly But we could head for big trouble if patients don't adhere to drugs or fail to get it in time,\" said infectious diseases specialist Dr George Oomen. The country has faced a stockout of HIV drugs in the past few years. Indeed, while year-on-year, incidence of new infection among the general population and pregnant women has shown a significant decline, that among risk groups continues to be a cause for concern. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance data of 2010-11, HIV among female sex workers in the city was around 6%, way higher than the national prevalence of 2.7%. However, the main sentiment on the eve of World AIDS Day is of positivity. \"What is the difference between HIV in 1985 and 2015? HIV+ people don't really frighten others anymore,\" said Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust, one of the first organisations started in the country to advocate for rights of men who have sex with men (MSM). \"People are living a prolonged life with antiretroviral therapy (ART),\" he said. Our biggest achievement is that we have killed the fear.\" Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS, said, \"We have come from a stage when HIV prevalence in Kamathipura was 54.3% in 2003. Today, the awareness is massive and everyone knows about ways of prevention.\" Mumbai currently has over 30,000 people living with the disease. A senior NGO member , who worked with FSWs in Kamathipura, said the disease is no longer a death sentence. \"We probably don't even know how many women must have died of AIDS. It is a rare thing today.\" But a doctor said the Indian program faces problems that government officials aren't ready to accept. so far. \"Less than a tenth of those who need second -line HIV drugs access them under the government programme. These patients will not only develop further resistance but even spread the disease in the community,\" hes aid. He added the happy picture could crumble in a few years at the rate it's progressing. \"The Centre has washed it hands of funding HIV AIDS programmes and states haven't realised their importance.\""

        "body": "Nagpur: Even though the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is facing severe financial crisis, it will spend 16.86 lakh for Aids awareness programme, which has already drawn criticism as the venue would also be used for recitation of Hanuman Chalisa by around 1.50 lakh people. On Saturday, the standing committee meet passed the proposal of NMC\u2019s public works department to spend 16.86 lakh for organizing the event. Standing panel chairman Sudhir Raut clarified that NMC would not spend a single penny on the religious function. \u201cWe would be using the platform to create Aids awareness programme,\u201d he said. The standing panel cleared another 10 proposals pertaining to various developmental works including giving administrative approval to hike the maintenance and operation costs of traffic signals. Shockingly, the panel ignored the abnormal revision of operation and maintenance cost by the electrical department. Though the officials concerned are neglecting maintenance of traffic signals, the nod would increase the annual operation and maintenance cost of these signals by 31.87%. The NMC\u2019s electrical department has proposed to increase operation and maintenance cost of 148 traffic signals and blinkers to 87.44 lakh from 66.31 lakh. \u201cThe contract for annual operation and maintenance of automatic traffic signals and blinkers with M/s Decofurn Constructions expired on March 11. Hence, the proposal for revision in maintenance cost,\u201d said NMC\u2019s deputy engineer (electric) M Bujade. He, however, could not explain why NMC was increasing maintenance cost every year even as traffic signals remained neglected. According to traffic police, around 50 traffic signals are defunct for months. \u201cAt least, 30 others have developed snags or faults due to lack of maintenance,\u201d said a head traffic constable. The cop added that the contractor had done a shoddy job and wondered why NMC is increasing the operation and maintenance cost. Sources said M/s Decofurn Constructions, which first got contract for maintenance of traffic signals for 17 lakh per annum in 2010, has often got flak for poor performance. In June 2015, the standing committee approved administration\u2019s proposal to revise the firm\u2019s contract to 66.31 lakh per annum from 30 lakh per annum in the previous year. To a query, standing committee chairman assured to investigate into the matter. Other proposals which get the nod including hiring of excavators to clean nullah before the onset of monsoon, selling of scraps of octroi (or LBT) department and tarring of roads in Hudkeshwar area. Raut claimed that the process to construct public toilets for women in commercial places was in final stage. In the first stage, the NMC would construct public toilets near Maharajbagh, Siraspeth and Prajapati Nagar. Besides, Borkar has also approached the collector to allow the NMC to construct a public toilet at Kasturchand Park."

These children were able to create comics following training provided by World Comics, India. These comics will be developed into panels and displayed by a Lucknow based NGO in the Sangam city on August 31. Dr Meesum SAM, assistant district programme officer, aids control, told TOI, \"Health authorities are sensitising people towards feelings of HIV positive people.'' \"Incidents of social boycott of HIV+ people are mainly reported in rural areas and we have been making efforts to apprise people about the actual facts related to HIV and AIDS,\" said Dr Meesum, adding that experts from UNICEF and health authorities are sensitising people on the disease. Last year, an eight-year-old boy, along with his cousin, was ousted by school authorities after the locals had mounted pressure on school authorities for the same. After a series of educational and awareness camps, the health authorities had managed to spread awareness and managed to make the villagers realise the trauma being faced by the victims. The officials of UP State Aids Control Society disclosed that till 2009, a total of 49,832 HIV positive and 10,072 AIDS patients had been identified across the state. District magistrate, Allahabad, Sanjay Prasad said, \"Sincere efforts are being made to spread awareness about HIV\\AIDS. Folk songs being performed by folk troupes have become an effective tool to spread awareness.'' On Saturday, a play titled `Shifa' will be staged at NCZCC on stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV\\AIDS.

She always keeps the mobile phone with her, having balance of merely Rs 3-4, to contact her husband, a factory worker who too is HIV positive, in case of an emergency. She is distressed with the discrimination and stigma attached to HIV patients. She said it was more agonizing when her three-and-a-half-year-old healthy son is shooed away by the neighbours. \"We are treated as untouchables. Our family throws food in front of me like it is given to dogs. Doctors don't want to operate me because I am HIV positive. We have consulted many eye surgeons but no one is ready to operate me. One of the famous eye surgeons in Chandigarh examined my eyes with ear buds and didn't even touch me,\" she told TOI on Tuesday. The only person in the couple's lives that shows them some ray of hope is Dr Vaneet Sareen who has not only financially helped the hapless couple but has also assured to spend up to Rs 1 lakh on treatment of her eyes through his organization Akhil Bhartiya Human Rights Welfare Association. \"It's unfortunate but true that most of the doctors have denied her treatment on one pretext or the other,\" said Sareen. Gurinder acquired the virus from her drug addict husband who shared the syringes with other addicts for injecting narcotics. She said, \"I don't know how long would I survive with HIV, but I want my eyesight back so that I can work and contribute financially to run my family.\" Groping her way to an almirah, Gurinder took out her old photographs and said, \"See how I looked then and what I have become now.\" Her eye treatment would cost around Rs 12 lakh, says her husband, adding: \"How can we afford it? Moreover, doctors are simply not ready to operate an HIV positive patient. Every doctor refers her to the other.\". Meanwhile, Dr Jyoti of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital said, \"She was undergoing antiretroviral therapy and had reaction from one of the drugs. But then we are giving same drugs to all HIV positive patients, hers is one out of a thousand case.\" The doctor also denied that HIV patients were not operated due to stigma or fear. \"Specialized doctors are operating the HIV positive patients like others. Sometimes the patient thinks that he or she is being discriminated against.\" Dr Jyoti said they had referred Gurinder even to private doctors but there were not much chances of her recovery."

NMC has called for participation of at least 1.5 lakh people in the event where people would take a pledge to follow a morally right lifestyle for prevention of AIDS. The event has thus been titled \u2018Naitikta ka Shankhnaad\u2019. Dayashankar Tiwari, leader of the ruling party in NMC, refused to comment on the Hanuman Chalisa event repeatedly reiterating he was following the court order. He did agree that the order would have an impact on two events. \u201cWe are aspiring to create a world record by holding the biggest health awareness event. The Guinness Book of World Records team will be present to monitor the claim,\u201d he said. \u201cSince NMC as an organization is trying for the record, no NMC official or worker can be deployed there. Volunteers have been picked up from various schools and colleges of the city,\u201d he said. So far 35,000 people have registered online. Some 250 NGOs and organizations in the city have assured participation, he said. To get the correct figure of number of people on the ground, counting machines have been installed at every entry point. \u201cThe machines are similar to those set up at Gajanan Maharaj temple in Shegaon. They will keep track of every entry and exit to get the correct number,\u201d Tiwari said. Loya Bagri & Company, a chartered accountant firm, has been appointed to audit the event. Streetplays organized by MSAC will be held on the stage set up at the venue. City based medico and AIDS expert Dr Milind Bhursudi will give a Powerpoint presentation on AIDS. As directed by the court, Hanuman Chalisa event will be held one hour after the NMC programme concludes. Tiwari said NMC would bear the cost of only the AIDS awareness event and the cost of the religious event will be borne by Poddareshwar Ram Mandir. He evaded the question of how this cost would be calculated as the people will already be gathered at the venue under the programme organized by NMC. Tiwari put the cost of holding the event at around Rs16 lakh. Excited about the two events in which he would be taking part, Swapnil Shamkuwar, a social worker, said that it was a matter of city\u2019s pride as it was staking claim for a world record. \u201cBack to back we will be taking an oath for leading a disciplined life and then worshipping Hanuman, a symbol of service and discipline. I think it is a wonderful idea,\u201d says Chetan Kayarkar, a builder. Looking forward to the event, college lecturer Varsha Bhisikar says this is a very positive initiative for creating health awareness. \u201cChanting Hanuman Chalisa along with more than one lakh people is once in a lifetime opportunity and I will be there to do that.\u201d"

        "body": "GUWAHATI: With little awareness about increasing Hepatitis-C cases in the northeast, activists and medical practitioners warned that unless effective programmes were implemented, there would be a further escalation in the number of people falling prey to the dreaded virus. Often referred to as a viral time bomb, the disease is widespread among intravenous drug users (IDUs). Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively. In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them. \"The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,\" said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON). With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV). \"Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,\" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water."

The NACO has placed five UP districts, including Allahabad, Azamgarh, Deoria, Etawah and Banda under its scanner after these districts were placed under sensitive category in migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. Allahabad being termed most sensitive, greater stress is being laid on collecting actual data of victims from all 20 blocks of the district and offering treatment and counseling to patients. UPSACS officials of are carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment as well as assistance. They are also conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV.. Nodal officer, District Aids Programme Control Unit ( DAPCU), Dr O P Shahi told TOI that migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi. Three kinds of migrants are primarily responsible for the spread of the deadly disease including workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for employment. Dr Shahi said under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities are busy locating the infected persons with the aim of offering them treatment, assistance and counseling. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and men having sex with men (MSM) so that concrete measures could be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been spreading awareness under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme. Last year, a NACO monitoring committee visited the city to find reasons behind the rapid increase in transmission of HIV in the district. The team had also inspected services being offered to HIV+ and AIDS patients at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC). The NACO initiative comes in the wake of Allahabad being placed under the high risk group as far as spread of HIV is concerned. Dr Shahi informed that the villages prone to high risk have been put under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps are being launched to check the menace. Pointedly, NACO has also asked UPSACS to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among prime carriers of HIV in the district. As far as route of infection and risk transmission categories are concerned, in about 85.3 per cent cases the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users and others, respectively. Currently, three NGOs are implementing the targeted interventions among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSM) and Intravenous drug users."

        "title": "WORLD CANCER DAY - Rare cancer afflicts Pune HIV+ woman",
        "body": "A 38 year old HIV infected woman from the city has been diagnosed with a rare cancer which has only 59 known patients worldwide. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an extremely rare type of cancer involving immune system cells. Its diagnosis corroborates findings of the landmark study conducted by National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) that has underlined an increase in certain cancers which are not commonly seen among people living with HIV AIDS in India. Known as a non-AIDS defining cancer (NADCs), ALCL can affect mouth, salivary glands, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, eye and brain among other organs. Researchers are trying to find out the reasons for their high growth rate. \"The woman, a homemaker, was brought to me on a wheel chair.She had severe pain in bones and had lost a lot of weight. ALCL is very difficult to diagnose because it is so rare. One needs to have a very high index of suspicion to diagnose this,\" said oncologist Padmaj Kulkarni of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, where the woman is being treated. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma of bone is extremely uncommon and only sporadic case studies are available in literature till date. \"The last case of this disease in an HIV infected patient was reported in \"Proceedings of Baylor University Medical Centre\" in 2015. The Pune woman is perhaps the 60th patient worldwide. It is rare even in non-HIV patients,\" Kulkarni said. Ameet Dravid, infectious diseases and HIV specialist from Pune, has been treating the woman. \"The woman came to me with complaints of fatigue and night sweating, back and neck pain and weight loss of five kg in a month. Her X-ray showed multiple lytic lesions and erosion of the bony areas in ribs while CT scan of chest and abdomen showed multiple osteolytic lesions showing severe bone loss in most vertebrae, ribs, both hips and sacroiliac joints which were suggestive of a cancer.\" Biopsy taken from her pelvic bone showed anaplastic large cell Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (ALCL). \"This cancer is very rare in HIV positive patients. In fact, in our series of 1,261 patients who had HIV with cancer, 30 were diagnosed with cancer. B-cell lymphomas were commonest while the woman is the only patient with ALCL,\" Dravid said. The woman was admitted to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in the second week of December last year for pain control, feeding and other supportive care. Her nuclear medicine imaging (PET-CT) scan was also unique as it showed that only bones were affected with no lymph nodes or any other organ being involved. The patient was put on chemotherapy. \"It was very difficult to give her the right dose of chemotherapy as low dose would not control her cancer while a high dose might lead to death. Her treatment is on and she has, so far, responded very well. She doesn't have severe pain and she comes walking for treatment and is now tolerating full dose of chemotherapy, which is the only treatment available for this type of cancer, \"Kulkarni said. Haematologist Sameer Melinkeri said, \"Patients with HIV infection commonly develop the more common B cell lymphomas. It is distinctly unusual for such patients to develop T cell lymphomas such as ALCL. The treatment for this patient is going to be a challenge since literature is scarce regarding the best line of treatment.\" Oncologist Tushar Patil of Sahyadri Specility hospitals said, \"The most common form of lymphoma in HIV affected patients is 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in late stages when CD 4 (type of white blood cell that fights infection) count drops to very low levels, we usually encounter Burkitt's lymphoma. ALCL in these patients is extremely rare though the management will still be same as ALCL in non-HIV patients. It is necessary to continue anti HIV treatment along with chemotherapy .\""

        "title": "Parliament passes bill to ensure equal rights to people affected by HIV",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: Parliament passed on Tuesday the bill to ensure equal rights to people affected by HIV and AIDS in getting treatment, jobs and admissions in educational institutions. Terming the unanimous passage of the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill in the Lok Sabha as \u201chistoric\u201d, Health Minister J P Nadda said the government \u201cstands committed for free treatment of HIV patients\u201d. It was passed by the Rajya Sabha on March 21. The bill assumes significance as it protects people living with HIV from specific acts of discrimination by the state, or any other person. It also lays down penal provisions for any discrimination practised against a person with HIV/AIDS and breach of confidentiality. Under the new law, central and state governments are obliged to provide for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and management of opportunistic infections (infections that take advantage of weakness in the immune system and occur frequently). The protection mandated under the law extends to the fields of employment, healthcare services, educational services, public facilities, property rights, holding public office and insurance. \u201cIt is not the case that before coming of this bill, these people (infected with HIV ) were not empowered but with its passage, they will get more powers,\u201d Nadda said. The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakh. Around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing a 66% decline in new infections from 2000. In 2015, around 68000 people died of AIDS-related causes nationally. Though the bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the legislation were revived by the Modi government in July 2016. Since then the health ministry has made various changes to the original bill to address several concerns raised by the the HIV community as well as state governments."

        "body": "BANGARMAU: Health authorities have taken action against 73 quacks by sealing their clinics in various localities of Bangarmau tehsil in Unnao district following spread of HIV in three villages due to alleged treatment by a quack. \u201cAs many 73 clinics of alleged quacks have been sealed. An FIR is being registered against three quacks while notices are being served to 44 others, who have been unable to produce degrees or relevant documents for running clinics,\u201d Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S P Chowdhary told TOI on Saturday. \u201cIf \u2018doctors\u2019 are not registered with the Medical Council of India, they have no right to practice medicine. We are taking action on complaints of quackery,\u201d the CMO added. An official spokesman said while some of these quacks were operating from their houses, others had opened clinics. \u201cOfficials have been asked to verify the credentials of the quacks who run advertisements on local TV channels in the district. The health department teams will also request cable operators to stop advertisements promoting tantriks and quacks,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, HIV affected people of the three villagers of Bangarmau \u2014 Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur \u2014 have demanded setting up of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau community health centre (CHC) to facilitate cheap and affordable treatment. At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus. \u201cMy 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,\u201d said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from Premganj where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month. \u201cMy daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can\u2019t afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,\u201d said Vinay. His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip. \u201cThe amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,\u201d he said. Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre. \u201cART treatment can\u2019t cure HIV/AIDS. There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,\u201d said an activist. A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. \u201cThey usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,\u201d he said. At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Of these, 33 were detected at a blood donation camp on February 3 while 25 had come to light last year."

        "body": "HYDERABAD: With 1,721 new cases during April-October, 2015 period, Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy have jointly topped the list in the number of HIV positive cases in Telangana state. In fact, Ranga Reddy registered 902 fresh HIV positive cases with a prevalence rate of 2.49%, followed by Hyderabad with 819 new HIV positive cases at a prevalence rate of 2.17%. Further, during the March 2014 to March 2015 period, 14,548 new HIV cases were detected of the total of 77,893 people, who were tested for the disease in Telangana with a prevalence rate of 1.84%. This startling data was revealed by officials of the Telangana State Aids Contro l Society on the sidelines of a World AIDS Day event, organized by United States Consulate General, Hyderabad on Friday evening to honour both private and public sector health practitioners involved in the prevention of HIVAIDS. Given the grim situation at hand, TSACs clearly will have a tough time in achieving the `Getting to zero' target \u00ad incidentally the theme of World AIDS Day-2015 to be observed on December 1. \u201cIn order to achieve the goal, we need to reach out to people who have not undergone the HIV test yet by taking up activities like education and communication (IEC), besides providing treatment and counselling to those who tested positive,\u201c said Dr John Babu, additional project director, TSACS. However, NGOs and health practitioners working on prevention of HIVAIDS, who attended the recent event in the city , said that there were several challenges that needed to be met before reaching the destination. \u201cThe syllabus being taught to medicos will not provide them with an opportunity to gain hands on experience on treatment of HIV patients. This has resulted in decline in interest among general physicians to practice HIV medicine,\u201c said Dr Dinakar, director, internal medicine, Sunshine Hospital. Similarly , Swapna, vice-president of the NGO Telugu Network of People Living with HIVAIDS working in the states of Telangana and AP, said how the civil society's failure in shunning the stigma attached to HIV patients is proving to be a blockade in providing treatment to them. \u201cI took a bold step in 2003 when I revealed my HIV positive status. Now, our NGO has a network of three lakh positive people in the two states,\u201c said Swapna. Meanwhile, earlier in his address, Michael C Mullins, consul general, consulate general of the United States of America, Hyderabad, said that U S President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is working closely with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) in various areas of HIV AIDS prevention in India like drugs, treatment, testing etc. \u201cIt's time to act now. Under PEPFAR, the US government has so far spent around $65 billion on programmes globally to combat HIV and AIDS,\u201c he said."

Also, at 69,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2017, the annual decline is almost 71%. But the declining rates don\u2019t tell the full story as there are several states showing a rising trend. Mizoram had the highest adult HIV prevalence in 2017, followed by Manipur at 1.43% and Nagaland at 1.15%. Maharashtra accounted for 15% of the national total. It was followed by Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, UP and Bihar. Around 87,000 new HIV infections were reported in 2017, marking an 85% decline in annual new HIV infections since the peak of 1995. New infections have increased in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Uttarakhand . On the other hand, Bihar, Bengal, Telangana, Delhi, Jharkhand and Haryana had decline rates lower than national average. Telengana topped in new HIV infections with about 9,324 new cases in 2017, which accounted for 11% of total new HIV infections. It is followed by Bihar, Bengal, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat. Together these 8 states account for two-thirds of all new annual HIV infections in India."

She denied intending to infect anyone with the virus. Benaissa, a member of the all-female pop group No Angels, was arrested last April just as she was about to perform at a Frankfurt nightclub and spent 10 days in custody before being released. In February this year she was charged with causing bodily harm. If convicted Benaissa faces between six months and 10 years in prison. A verdict is due on on August 26. According to the charge sheet, she had sex on five occasions between 2000 and 2004 with three people and did not tell them she was infected, even though she had known since 1999. One of the three had since been confirmed as being infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, prosecutors had said. No Angels shot to fame in 2000 thanks to a TV talent show and had a string of hits in central Europe before splitting up in 2003. They reformed in 2007 and competed in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The singer, who has an 11-year-old daughter, has not yet developed the symptoms of AIDS."

Its hit list includes human rhinoviruses - the bugs that causes colds in adults and in children - flu, polio, a stomach bug and deadly dengue fever. But DRACO is also expected to zap measles and German measles, cold sores, rabies and even HIV - and could be on pharmacy shelves in a decade, the Daily Mail reported. Lead researcher Mike Rider said, \"It's certainly possible that there's some virus that we aren't able to treat but we haven't found it yet.\" In lab tests, DRACO killed 15 viruses.

The situation is even worse in rural areas, where only 14.7% of women (age 15-49 years) have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Over the past few years, the National AIDS Control Society has cut down funds given to AIDS control society across the country. It could be one of the reasons of lack of comprehensive awareness of HIV/AIDS among population of the state. In 2005-06 (NFHS-3), it was shown that 17.3% of woman had comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS in the state. It means that the situation has not improved significantly over the past ten years. Among males, the situation is slightly better. According to NFHS -4, there are 37.4% of males having comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS.

        "title": "Coming soon: Life insurance policy for HIV/AIDS patients",
        "body": "CHENNAI: Life insurance for people with AIDS and HIV may soon become a reality. The insurance regulator has issued draft guidelines seeking views and comments from insurers on issuing life cover policies to persons with HIV/AIDS. The draft circular by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on policies for people with HIV/AIDS, issued this month, may come into effect from April 2014. Insurers are expected to put in place a board-approved underwriting manual, claims manual, proposal form and other necessary systems before this date. A vast majority of those afflicted in India are in the age bracket of 15 to 49 years. As per estimates, about 2.4 million Indians are living with HIV/AIDS. Children less than 15 years account for 3.5% of it while 83% are in the age group of 15-49 years. Health cover for people suffering from HIV/AIDS already exists. With advances in medical treatment, insurers are able to put in place cost structures. Some standalone health insurance providers like Star Health & Allied Insurance offer such insurance. \"We offer group covers to NGOs for their members. Our policy prescribes the entry parameters,\" V Jagannathan, chairman, Star Health said. Insurers say claims management and profitability will be key concerns when life insurance is offered to those with AIDS. There would be additional costs. \"In terms of product pricing, insurers mostly rely on past claims experience. Since this would be a new product altogether, the pricing could be at both ends of the spectrum. Insurers may start at the lower range, get claims and then revise premiums upwards. They may also err on the side of caution with higher rates in the beginning and as more players come into the market, the rates would become more competitive,\" Rahul Aggarwal, CEO of Optima Insurance Brokers, said. \"The premium loadings would also depend on the age of the person and stage of the condition,\" Vikas Gujral, executive vice-president and head, customer service and operations, Max Life Insurance said. Some companies are looking at dual cover\u2014health in addition to life\u2014to ensure better claim control. \"We may insist on a health cover before issuing a life cover for this segment because in case of AIDS/HIV, the patient has lower immunity than the rest of the population. So, he/she is susceptible to other illnesses as well,\" a life insurer said. Industry observers say that due to the nature of the condition, insurers would also have to contend with a huge claims outgo. \"Chances are high that the insured may use up the sum insured every year and once a policy is issued, it cannot be withdrawn,\" Aggarwal said. Insurers are also playing it safe. Companies like Max and HDFC have already started talks with global reinsurers to participate in this scheme. \"This is a fairly complex product and we are taking inputs from reinsurers as they have global exposure on this front,\" Sanjay Tiwari, vice-president, products, HDFC Life said. \"We would have to keep tabs on patient check-ups, keep abreast of the latest medicines as all of that would go into our claims experience data,\" Gujral said."

Saturday\u2019s delivery takes JJ\u2019s tally of childbirths by HIV-positive women to 1,004 in the last 10 years. This is not an ordinary achievement for J J staffers as not many hospitals are willing to 0take up HIV-positive pregnancy cases. \u201cMost of the HIV-positive pregnant women who come to us are either denied admission by hospitals or are referred to us,\u201d said Dr Rekha Daver, head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at J J. The incidence of the babies born with HIV-positivity also has been low, claims the hospital. \u201cWe cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,\u201d said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT). The hospital has achieved the feat with the help of a certain medicine and delivery method. \u201cAccording to the guidelines, we give nevrapin before the delivery. We prefer doing a normal delivery\u2014one without making any incisions\u2014to avoid mixing of the mother\u2019s blood with the baby\u2019s. Also, we give the mother the choice to breastfeed, even though there\u2019s a slight chance of virus transmission,\u201d added Dr Daver. Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. \u201cPublic hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,\u201d said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS. Dr Y S Nandanwar, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Sion Hospital said that they may have assisted in 1,000 positive deliveries too. \u201cWe do not have the exact record, but the incidence of conducting an HIV-positive delivery is 1% in our hospital. Since we conduct more than 10,000 normal deliveries in a year, we must be conducting around 100 HIV-positive deliveries,\u201d he said."

The report, which has an endorsement by Punjab's own AIDS Control Society run by the health department, says: \"Although the main HIV transmission route continues to be sexual, HIV positivity among IDUs too has emerged as a major concern for the state.\" At present, there are 15,545 IDUs in Punjab. The report is based on the national sentinel surveillance data (NSSD), a wing under the Union ministry of health and family welfare. During a recent visit to Chandigarh, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi had courted controversy over his comment that seven out of 10 youths in Punjab were drug addicts. Rahul's comment had evoked sharp reactions from Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal and the state government officials. The report, however, also says that both Punjab and Manipur have shown a decline in HIV prevalence among IDUs from the previously recorded data of 26% and 25% in 2008. Between June 2007 and October 2012, 2,505 people had died due to HIV in Punjab. Alongside Gujarat and Goa, the state has also recorded the highest adult HIV prevalence at 0.32%."

        "body": "THANE: The Thane district court has upheld the order of a magistrate ordering a 25-year-old man to pay maintenance to his HIV infected wife, and dismissed the appeal filed against it by the husband and his parents. The woman stated in her application that her marriage was solemnised with the man, a resident of Kalamboli in Raigad district, on May 20, 2013, in Uttar Pradesh. While the couple was residing in Ahmedabad, the woman became pregnant following which her blood test was done in which it was revealed that she was HIV positive. Following the disclosure, the husband sent the woman to her parents' house and they bore the expenses of her delivery and medical treatment. The woman, now residing at her parents house since she is unable to maintain herself and her child, sought interim relief, including Rs 37,000 maintenance per month. After hearing both the parties, Thane Judicial Magistrate had earlier ordered the husband to pay Rs 6,000 per month as maintenance to his wife. However, the woman's husband and his parents challenged the magistrate's order which was recently upheld by the court of District Judge P P Jadhav. Judge Jadhav observed that the applicant (woman) is residing with her parents because of refusal by opponents (husband and his family) to allow her to co-habit with them. At this stage, it cannot be ascertained as to how the applicant got infected with HIV. \"The fact that she was diagnosed HIV+ve after the marriage is itself sufficient to conclude that she got infected while continuation of her marital relationship with the opponent,\" the court observed. \"Under such circumstances, being husband it was the boundant duty of the opponent to look after her and maintain her properly,\" the Judge said. Though the opponents have not denied responsibility to maintain the child, no evidence is produced on record to show that the opponent is spending any amount for the same. Under such circumstances, the applicant being wife and having a child from opponent is entitled to be maintained by him, the court ruled while concluding that the order passed by the magistrate is proper, correct and legal."

The state government will be following the NACP guidelines to eradicate HIV in Jharkhand, JSACS said. As per NACP, the state governments are to create awareness at specified intervention zones that include holding awareness camps for sex workers and truckers, screening of migrating people upon their return. JSACS is scheduled to set up awareness camps in 21 red-light areas across Jharkhand for sex-workers, three points for educating truckers, JSACs officer Dr Debashish Chakraborty said. The health department will also strengthen its anti-natal check-up mechanisms (ANC) and consolidate its sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics across the state, it said. At present, there are 28 permanent STI clinics and ICTC link centers across the state. Meanwhile, JSACS will stage an awareness rally in the state capital on Tuesday to mark World Aids Day."

Under the programme, the government plans to intensify and consolidate prevention services with a focus on high-risk groups and vulnerable population. It will also focus on expanding information, education and communication (IEC) services for general population and high-risk groups (HRGS) with a focus on behaviour change and demand generation. Other objectives include increasing access and promoting comprehensive care, support and treatment, building capacities and strengthening strategic information management systems. NACP was started in 1992 with the third phase conducted between 2007-2012 with the objective to \"halt and reverse the HIV epidemic In India\" by the end of the project.

She was pregnant when she found out that her husband was HIV positive and had concealed the information from her. Betrayed, she came back. The bigger shock came when pregnancy tests revealed that her husband had passed the virus on to her. \"I had seen my husband remain ill all the time because of HIV. When I came to India, I consulted a doctor who put me on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) right away and asked me to have a nutritious diet. I made it my mantra. Except for normal coughs and colds, which normal people suffer during changes of season, I have not remained ill,\" says Manisha. Manisha says her good health prompted her to start a beauty parlour in partnership with her best friend. \"I feel very energetic and have never felt sick. My attitude towards HIV has changed through my own experience\", says Manisha. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel, who was one of the first private practitioners to dedicate himself to treating HIV, says viral load becomes undetectable in patients on ART therapy after just six months of treatment. \"With this treatment, only the diagnostic test tells if a person is HIV positive. Otherwise, viral load becomes undetectable in the blood,\" says Dr Patel. \"I have a number of patients who have been treated for the last 10 years and a few have lived for more than 12-14 years! My oldest patient is a 96-year old gentleman who has been living healthily with HIV for 12 years,\" says Dr Patel. He says that most patients who have done well have followed their treatments well, have paid attention to what they eat, and more importantly, have had good family support. \"Good family support somehow adds years and cuts down the illness\", says Dr Patel. Ahmedabad: When you first meet Manoj Parmar, 31, he appears healthy, with a wide, infectious smile. His story touches people deeply. Manoj has been battling HIV for nine years. He was diagnosed with the virus in 2003. Scared and shocked, he was left with no option but to keep this news to himself. After three years of struggle, in 2006, he came out and shared the news with his family. \"I was helpless and didn't know who to turn to for advice. Those three years were the hardest for me since there were no medicines available for treatment at that time,\" he says. His suffering motivated and inspired him to become a counselor in the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI). Now he counsels people suffering from HIV and AIDS. He is one of the few people who is an HIV patient as well as a HIV counsellor. \"The most vital aspect for an AIDS patient is that they should take great care that the disease does not spread to another person. My wife is also an HIV positive patient, but we take full preventive measures.\" In fact, the couple was living such a normal life that they felt confident adopting the girl child from their wife's first marriage. \"I am very lucky to get moral and emotional support from my family and friends. Their acceptance level has motivated me to live a normal life without any shame or guilt. I believe that my behavior is important, not status. Live till you die, is what I tell all my patients in my counseling sessions.\" \"Whether it's an accident or a deadly disease like AIDS, one should live life happily and healthily. Exercise regularly, do yoga, eat nutritious food and create a positive environment. Also emotional and mental support from those close to us is necessary to live a good, positive life. AIDS patients are just like normal people and one should not discriminate against them,\" he concludes."

The preliminary data of the 2011 study jointly undertaken by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) has revealed that the state witnessed a sharp decline in HIV prevalence among the high risk groups. If the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 11% in 2008, it has dropped to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. Officials said that the substantial drop in HIV prevalence among female sex workers, which was very high in AP, was an achievement. The state has 1.56 lakh sex workers. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation alone has 22,000 female sex workers and 4,000 MSMs. Apsacs officials said that the condom usage has increased considerably resulting in the decline of HIV infections. Kailash Aditya, joint director (targeted interventions) said that the health seeking behaviour among the high risk groups has gone up which was earlier not the case. \"This is a very positive sign,\" said Aditya. Officials noted that about two to three years ago, there was a huge scale up of the fatal disease in the state. AP figured among the top five states with highest incidents of HIV. Apsacs subsequently stepped up its interventions going till the grass root level to deal with the high risk groups. Currently, there are 169 targeted interventions in the state. Of these, 23 targeted interventions are being directly implemented by the Community Based Organisations (CBOs). Because of the ownership of the CBOs, the HIV/AIDS prevention services reach a large number of community members, officials said. However, of the 22,000 female sex workers in GHMC jurisdiction, Apsacs has access to just about 16,000 sex workers indicating that better surveillance is required. As far as the state is concerned, the total number of people living with HIV/AIDS is estimated to be over 5 lakh. Of these, 3.75 lakh are registered with Apsacs."

        "body": "VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh, which has the dubious distinction of housing the highest number of HIV-AIDS patients, was allotted 25% of the total condoms from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in 2012-2013 and 27% was allocated in the ongoing fiscal year. In 2012-13, out of 440 million condoms, 109 million was given to AP while the remaining 331 was distributed among other 27 states as per information from AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS). While these figures are indicative of greater awareness and health seeking behaviour among the vulnerable population to arrest the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI), the chances of misuse and wastage can't also be ruled out according to medical experts. In AP there are around five lakh people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Again at least 60 % of these allocated condoms are distributed to vulnerable districts where incidences of HIV and targeted interventions (TI) are more. According to APSACS, these include the nine coastal districts, Warangal, Khammam, Anantapur, Karimnagar and Chittoor. \"Though initially, there was some resistance from certain people due to religious issues or social customs, gradually they understood the importance of using condoms and practicing safe sex, which in turn brought down new incidences of HIV-AIDS and STI among various high risk groups (HRG),\" averred T Kailashditya, joint director (TI), APSACS. In the last 3 to 5 years, incidence of STI has plummeted from 18% to 2% among the HRGs, HIV rate has come down from 11% to 7% among female sex workers, from 23% to 10% among MSMs (men having sex with men), from 7% to 3.75% among injectable drug users while among ante-natal women it has come down from 1.22% to 0.77%, as per data from APSACS. \"The 176 targeted interventions among various HRGs and link workers scheme in 19 districts, ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centres) services, free distribution of condoms and AIDS education and counselling even in 1,300 primary health centres in the state have enhanced the awareness levels of people,\" pointed out Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, APSACS. Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (ADMHO), Vizag, added, \"Due to the greater usage of condoms, including female condoms, among the HRG, the incidence of new HIV infections is also coming down. Since, people were apprehensive of the quality of freely distributed condoms from the government, NACO is now into social marketing of condoms to inculcate the habit of purchasing these among public. A pack of three condoms comes at a nominal cost of Rs 4 and 80-90% of the HRG are using it. However, some doctors are skeptical about the claims of the state government regarding condom usage and control of HIV. They point to misuse and wastage of condoms. Padmasri Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao and a specialist in treating HIV patients, said, \"Greater demand for condoms does not imply that there is high awareness among the general public. It's also indicative of increased sexual promiscuity and wastage of free condoms distributed by the government. We have come across households where free condoms are just discarded or the children inflate these as balloons and play. Even in 2012, 4.19 lakh HIV cases were detected in AP.\" But ruling out chances of wastage, Kailashditya claimed, \"We have mechanisms to ensure that the condoms are not misused or wasted. Peer educators ensure that adequate number of condoms is distributed to HRGs while NACO's outlet boxes are kept in HIV hotspots for people to pick up free condoms whenever they require.\""

The Technical Research Group (TRG) has recently recommended community based screening using whole blood finger prick tests in population that has remained unaddressed. The TRG has also recommended testing in existing targeted intervention sites, community based screening through health camp approach for truckers and migrants, and provider initiated testing and counseling for pregnant women and TB patients. The NACO has also accepted the WHO's recommendation of using ancillary health care providers, including peer counsellors, for conducting HIV screening after adequate training. Other recommendations of TRG include acceptance of pre-test information instead of pre-test counseling and verbal consent in order to decrease the time and inconvenience for the testing and counseling procedure. The age of consent for HIV testing has also been recommended to be reduced to 16 instead of 18 to enhance early diagnosis. \"AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been a front-runner in the advocacy for community based testing globally for more than eight years and has conducted more than 7 million tests globally in the past two years. AHF, through its implementing partner in India, India Cares, has conducted more than 220000 tests and identified more than 1900 unreached people living with HIV/AIDS in India,\" said Dr Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager, AHF India. \"HIV testing must be scaled up in a big way around the world. Governments need to embrace community-based streamlined testing models that use rapid testing technologies and make testing free, convenient, hassle-free and easily accessible, particularly for the most affected populations. Testing results should be available the same day and there needs to be strong linkage to care and services for those who test HIV-positive,\" said Terri Ford, AHF chief of global advocacy and policy."

This, despite the fact Chhattisgarh is among one of 13 states that account for 90% of HIV infected pregnant women in India. Union health ministry had fixed deadline of April 2014 for implementation of its programme, Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) services, in all government run hospitals and health centres in the 12 affected districts of Chhattisgarh. However, four months after lapse of the deadline, PPTCT services are yet to start in health centres of the state.

A recent NACO report on multi-drug anti-retro virals for PPTCT of HIV under National AIDS Control Programme in India, an estimated 1,097 HIV infected pregnant woman require PPTCT services in Chhattisgarh. As per the report 159 pregnant women were detected with HIV 2012-13. NACO officials said efforts are on to make HIV testing of all pregnant women mandatory in government hospitals. They admitted though consent of expecting mothers is required for a HIV test, they would counsel reluctant ones to ensure their participation. Officials said if a pregnant woman is tested positive, efforts are made to reduce chances of transmission of HIV to her child by giving Navirapine Prophylaxis. A dose of navirapine is given to mother at the time of delivery to prevent HIV transmission to child. According to NACO report, while 100% medical colleges and district hospitals have an HIV testing facility across the country, about 86% sub-district hospitals have the same. But lower down in the health system the levels of saturation differ in different phases."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The budget has good news for poor HIV/AIDS patients. In a unique initiative, the state government has proposed monthly financial assistance of Rs 1,000 for patients suffering from the disease. While orphaned children infected with HIV/AIDS will get Rs 2,050 per month, other children will get Rs 1,750 per month. The budget has earmarked an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore for the ambitious health scheme. This scheme was among the key highlights of Delhi government's budget for 2012-13 in the health sector, for which Rs 2,124 crore (14.16% of the total outlay) has been allocated. State health minister AK Walia told TOI that more than 300 beneficiaries have already been identified for the issuance of the assistance money. \"There are about 10,000 HIV/AIDS patients registered with us for anti-retroviral treatment. These patients need extra nutrition and balanced diet to cope with their compromised immune system. The financial aid is aimed at helping such patients,\" said Walia. In a relief for thalassaemia patients, the government will introduce VAT exemption on 'blood bags' (lucocite filters), which will reduce the cost of blood storage and transfusion. The introduction of improved immunisation cover for children with pentavalent vaccine, which is administered for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and haemophilus influenza type B, was also announced in the budget. Expansion of the ambulance fleet, increasing the number of dialysis machines at hospitals and improving the infrastructure at Delhi State Cancer Institute were among other highlights. However, the budget proposals for the health sector, pertaining to development of health infrastructure, can largely be described as old wine in new bottle. It proposes to increase the number of hospital beds per thousand population in the capital from 2.55 (beds per thousand population) at present to three (beds per thousand population). For this, the government has said new hospitals will be constructed at Burari, Ambedkar Nagar, Hastsal and Sarita Vihar, among other places - most of these projects were mentioned in last year's budget also."

The district, which reported 1021 positive cases in 2010, saw a declining trend in this regards, thanks to several initiatives of the district AIDS control Unit. Udupi taluk topped the list with 375 cases this year. This was followed by Kundapur taluk with 101 positive cases and Karkala with 42 cases.

The district has also managed to control effectively the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy. The statistics from the department of health and family welfare indicate that their number has reduced to 10 this year from the 32 cases last year. Dr H Ashok, district AIDS control officer, said that the district unit aims at achieving zero HIV positive cases in Udupi. ''Though the figures show that Udupi taluk has the highest number of positive cases, it is not true. This is because people from other districts are coming for tests in a private hospital in Manipal. Otherwise, Kundapur taluk has the most positive cases and about 45 per cent of the total positive cases reported are from that taluk,\" he added. The department has requested MP K Jayaprakash Hegde to sanction funds for opening an Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) center at the taluk hospital in Kundapur. This year till October, 459 persons have joined the pre-ART center. As many as 3,047 patients have availed services at the ART+ Center situated near the district government hospital in Ajjarakad from the time of its inauguration in July 2008 till today."

At present, India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at .31% \u2014 from .36% in 2006. Be that as it may, though seven lakh HIV+ Indians require the life-saving anti-retroviral (ART) drugs, only three lakh have access to the medicine. As far as mother-to-child transmission of HIV is concerned, India recorded 18,000 pediatric HIV births off 65,000 HIV+ mothers. India records 27 million pregnancies a year. These are the latest data from the 2010 AIDS epidemic report \u2014 the most comprehensive report on a single disease that was released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. For the first time, experts say the HIV epidemic is on the wane. At least, 56 countries have either stabilised or achieved significant fall in rates of new HIV infections. \"For the first time, we can see the world beginning to truly reverse the AIDS epidemic. Globally, it had peaked in 1999-2000. In Asia, it had peaked in 2003-04. The biggest problem in India is that too many people don't know that they are infected with HIV. Every HIV case is preventable and to have 1.2 lakh new infections in India show that we are not doing enough,\" said Dr Charles Gilks, who heads UNAIDS in India. He added, \"It is vital that India focuses on prevention as cost of treatment will continue to increase.\" Not only has new HIV infection rate fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 (3.1 million people had got infected in 1999), but AIDS-related deaths have also come down by nearly 20% in the last five years.

According to the officials, around 250 HIV positive deliveries take place in Vizag district every year. As per the PPCT treatment, HIV testing is conducted on all pregnant women and if found positive, anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is administered from the 14th week of pregnancy, irrespective of the CD4 count. Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs. Additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said, \"Currently, around 8,000 HIV positive pregnant women are undergoing ART in Vizag as per the government records. We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case.\" Besides a decrease in vertical transmission in antenatal cases, focus is given on bringing down HIV-TB co-infections. \"Since HIV patients develop tuberculosis as an opportunistic infection, we are focusing on such patients too so that incidence of HIV-TB can be brought down. The three ART centres and 15 Link ART centres in the district along with a few NGOs are playing a crucial role in controlling HIV in newborns and TB patients due to timely treatment,\" added the ADMHO. T Kailashaditya, joint director (targeted intervention), AP State AIDS Control Society, said, \"With greater awareness about HIV, health seeking behaviour among high risk groups as well as the public has gone up. Therefore, incidence of new HIV cases is decreasing in all groups such as female sex workers, truckers, MSM population, injectible drug users, pregnant women and TB patients in the state.\""

A team of 25 sex workers, mainly women who are trained by Society for People Actions for Development (SPAD) an NGO, will visit areas where sex workers assemble and convince them to use condoms and undergo an HIV test every six months. Apart from educating, a team works on the treatment of HIV and other STDs for fellow sex workers. Some times, they also counsel couple suffering from HIV. According to the sources, twin cities have nearly 1400 sex workers, of them, 40% women sex workers are operating from homes while 60% are doing their profession on the streets of twin cities.Members of peer educators will visit all busy spots like slums, theatres, bus-terminus both old and new, market area, parks, gardens, and railway station where sex workers will wait in search of their customers.

Representatives of over 500 NGOs from Gujarat, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra met at the two-day western regional meet that concluded in Pune on Monday. Besides discussing the performance of the third phase of NACP, strategies were recommended for a more participatory, inclusive, transparent and peoplecentric framework for the fourth phase. \"We asked the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to ensure all processes such as budget planning, procurement and expenditure are made transparent and accessible to all. NGOs and the community should also be made part of planning, evaluation and governance structures and should not remain mere implementers,\" said Mathew Mattam of the Indian People\u2019s Alliance for Combating HIV/AIDS (IPACHA). \"We are questioning the programme design which on one hand prioritizes highly funded campaigns like the Red Ribbon Express, but ignores the issues of children affected and infected with HIV,\" said Father Jobish from Madhya Pradesh who runs a care and support programme for children in the absence of a state response. The delegates also suggested that short stay homes for HIV orphans need to be started across the country which could be linked up with foster families. \"The new design should be more horizontal than vertical,\" suggested Vinay Kulkarni of NGO Prayas, adding, \"the third phase of the National AIDS Programme was more target based and we were able to achieve success on many fronts. But while doing this, the quality factor got compromised. We need to emphasize on increasing the quality of services.\" Representatives of People\u2019s Health Organisation (PHO) shared a concern that often the community does not get quality counselling at the ART centres. The government is also unable to reign in private players doling out medicines to HIV patients without following the prescribed guidelines. \"All this will lead to a severe crisis and we will soon face multi-drug resistance with the ART medicines. And if that happens then we do not even have medicines to combat it,\" the NGO cautioned. Jyoti, an MSM (men who have sex with men) peer educator, stated that counselling aspect should be re-looked and moulded as per age and gender specific needs. \"Groups like MSMs /TGs (transgenders) should be dealt with more sensitivity and the counsellors should go beyond routine counselling for such groups,\" he said. Some delegates also suggested making counselling child centric so as to counsel HIV positive adolescent children. \"We have been able to reach out to only 40% of the population who are at high risk,\" said a delegate from Gujarat, Father Thomas. \"In Gujarat, most of the services are urban centric. Remote villages are still not covered and the common villager still equates HIV to malaria. This is the population that we want to be bring into the programme,\" he added. The recommendations made by NGOS will be summated as \u2018national recommendations\u2019 for NACP IV, which will be presented to Health minister Gulam Nabi Azad in Delhi on June 19."

It aimed at sending out a positive message about people afflicted with HIV and on the social stigma surrounding the disease. The play, loosely based on a true story, has been written by Abhijit Bhattacharjya, a noted theatre playwright who is almost synonymous with the Assamese mobile theatre circuit because of the plethora of plays that he has scripted in a career spanning over a decade. The play is an attempt to make people more sympathetic towards people suffering from AIDS. The play was staged by Rashtriya theatre, a theatre troupe from Dharapur in the city. It will continue for six days at the same venue and later travel to other places in the state. \u201cThe story revolves around a protagonist who one day discovers that he has AIDS. Even though he is battling a severe disease, he is forced to marry,\u201d said Bhattacharjya. \u201cPeople suffering from AIDS are ostracized. The protagonist in my play is a good human being. He draws a line between him and his wife so that she is not infected. But she and his family disowns him upon knowing that he has AIDS and it is only in the end that they realize he was a good man,\u201d added Bhattacharjya. The new season is expected to have subjective themes and will also include symbolism. One such play with symbolism is \u2018Ran Kukur\u2019 or \u2018The Wolf\u2019 which is an attempt to speak against a corrupt system. The concept of the Assamese mobile theatre is considered unique due to its concept. It is only here in Assam where theatre troupes tour different places across the state. For the next eight months, the mobile theatre companies will be staging different productions. With different mobile theatre companies touring the state, competition is stiff. The budget is sometimes close to Rs 1 crore. Mobile theatre is not only entertaining but an employment generating avenue as well. Hundreds of people are dependent on such companies."

Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54 per cent of the total HIV infected population in India, a bulk of them having been transmitted the disease from their parents at birth. Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS is the next major challenge for India, the risk of which can be successfully minimised or even eliminated with effective and sustained use of medication,\u201d said Dr P Haranath, dermatologist from Bhavya Skin Care Centre, Vizag. As per NACO Technical Estimate Report (2015), out of an estimated 29 million annual pregnancies in India, about 35,255 occur in HIV positive pregnant women. This data postulates that in the absence of any intervention, over 10,000 babies infected with HIV are being born every year. According to World Health Organization, without any intervention, transmission rates range from 15 per cent to 45 per cent. \u201cPutting infected expectant mothers on anti-retroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is discovered is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also put on a brief six-week therapy to combat the threat. This protocol can successfully prevent mother-to-child transmission in most cases,\u201d he said. Relentless awareness campaigns and successful use of anti-retroviral therapy has helped India reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS prevalence steadily over the past two decades. India\u2019s new infections were estimated to be at 86,000 in 2015, showing a marked decline by 66% as compared to the year 2000. Visakhapatnam District AIDS Control Society organised an awareness programme on World AIDs Day at the AU Assembly Hall on Thursday. Addressing the gathering on the occasion, vice-chancellor Prof G Nageswara Rao underlined the importance of the awareness and knowledge on the health problems of unprotected sex and the diseases like AIDS. He said students, in particular, should play a vital role on eliminating such social evils from the society for a better and health society by bringing awareness among the masses about the ill effects of the diseases and causes of the disease. Meanwhile, the Medical Department of Waltair Division of East Coast Railway also observed World AIDS Day on Thursday by organizing awareness programmes and taking out a rally to propagate the fall out of the dreaded disease. In the Agency areas, NGO Nature along with Araku Area Hospital and hostels took out a rally and formed a human chain at Araku.

Hundreds of college students participated in the event by applying different colours to palms and arms depicting powerful messages such as \u201cKnow AIDS: No AIDS, Safe Sex Prevents AIDS, ART Adherence: 75 Years of Life. Students also performed flash mobs on HIV awareness at different places in the city based on the theme. Chief guest of the event, HIV/AIDS expert Padmashri Dr Kutikupala Surya Rao, said as a result of advanced researches in AIDS treatment, now the patients can be given a substantial life and death can be postponed."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: They live the nightmare everyday, suffering the stigma of being HIV carriers. Little hearts, but sunk by an overwhelming thought that death may strike early. They live in the shadows and prefer anonymity for fear of discrimination. And those who go to school are often ostracized. Nor do they get specialized treatment despite massive funds being pumped for HIV care. What\u2019s shocking is that their numbers are in thousands in Delhi. The city has at least 11,333 children infected with HIV. Most of them, nearly 2000, are concentrated in south Delhi and around 1,700 in the New Delhi area. Others are scattered across the city. The plight of these children has been highlighted in a study commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR). The report states that the nine anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres are not wellequipped and HIV-infected kids are yet to receive benefits of any government scheme. DCPCR has now sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children. A potent anti-retroviral regimen helps suppress the HIV virus and preserves normal immune response in children. The study was carried out by ARADHYA (Action for Resource Development in Health-Education by Youth Association) over a period of four months \u2014 starting March this year. The objective was to map children infected by HIV. Volunteers collected data from the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, ART centres, integrated counseling centres, blood banks, private doctors, counsellors and related agencies to find out the number of HIV patients in the city. Since many cases go unreported, the actual number may be much higher. The report also mentions there are 68,369 HIV-infected persons in the age-group of 14-24 . \u201cWe received complaints about discrimination of HIVinfected children in schools. It was then that we decided to collect data on these children. There are at least 77,000 kids below 14 years of age in the country who are HIV-infected . Over 11,000 are in Delhi alone,\u201d said M M Vidyarthi, member, DCPCR. He also said most kids contract HIV from their mothers. Many of those registered for treatment hail from migrant families. Since many of them don\u2019t have identity or residential proofs, they lose out on welfare schemes. HIV-infected kids orphaned by AIDS do not even have a means of livelihood. \u201cThough most parents are sensitive towards their children , they don\u2019t put them through institutional medical care for fear of discrimination ,\u201d he said. The study also states \u201cthere are no proper shelters for these kids and they also miss out on schemes for specialized care. Also, the schools are not sensitized enough to provide psychological support to combat trauma .\u201d The focus group carrying out the study also met various families and found that the fare concession while travelling to ART centres promised to HIV-infected by National AIDS Control Organisation in 2008 are difficult to avail because of government red-tape . DCPCR chairperson Amod Kanth said, \u201cWe have sent our recommendations and plan of action to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children.\u201d These recommendations include setting up more state-run sponsorship programmes for HIV-positive children for primary and higher education, hostel facilities for infected children, separate schemes for HIV-positive widows, better access to welfare schemes and effective implementation of schemes."

Recently, a workshop for 30 out of the 75 red ribbon clubs was held at Margao wherein officials of GSACS briefed club members on conducting various activities related to AIDS awareness. \u201cThe second workshop will be held at Quepem for another 30 clubs, while for the remaining 35 clubs a similar session will be conducted at Canacona,\u201d he said."

The HIV infected people of Premganj and two other villages had asked the authorities to set up an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau CHC for treatment as going by their poor health and financial conditions, it was very difficult for them to continue their treatment. The news item regarding the same was carried by the Times of India in its February 11 edition. At present, GSVM medical college is catering to the treatment at its anti-retroviral therapy (ART) Centre. ART is a therapy that improves quality of life of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus."

The local police has asked Poonam to hire a vehicle and give them money for petrol and \u2018other expenses\u2019 if she wants them to locate her husband. Poonam was only 16 years old when she got married to Rajesh, a salesman in a local firm. She came to know about her positive status during delivery of her daughter in May last year.

With rising awareness more number of people are approaching for health check-up and are not hesitating to ask about the diseases and the precautionary steps to avoid the same.\" The number of positive cases in pregnant women has also gone down over the past years. The department screened 24,875 women and found only 39 positive cases in 2012 while last year 56 pregnant women were identified positive. As per the comparative figures the positive percentage is 0.15% in the city, which was 0.24% last year.

READ: Charlie Sheen's open letter on his HIV + diagnosis Magic Johnson The former NBA star was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1991 and since then he has not only controlled the virus from progressing into AIDS through strict medical and exercise regime, but has also become one of the most vocal activists lending support to HIV infected people. Immediately after Sheen announced that he\u2019s HIV positive, Magic Johnson tweeted: \u201cI wish @CharlieSheen and his family the best. With the advancement in treatments and medicine he can fight this disease and live a long life. In breaking his silence, I hope he joins me in educating the world about HIV/AIDs.\u201d Holly Johnson The former Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman was diagnosed with the illness in 1991 and thought he would be the latest in a long line of famous faces who fell victim to AIDS. However, he has fought for his health tooth and nail and survived. Although it\u2019s not exactly been a bed of roses. He confessed in an interview: \u201cI live like a nun. I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t smoke, I haven\u2019t done for years. I take copious amounts of vitamins and medications. I do everything possible to support my health.

Fit and fine at 55, now he has put the criticism levied at him for his head injury in 1988 Olympics behind him, wherein he was accused of putting divers to the risk of HIV. It cost him dearly with no sponsor willing to support him. Today, Louganis, a staunch supporter of those fighting HIV/AIDS, is going all out to support Sheen. \u201cIt can happen to anybody. Viruses are indiscriminate and opening up the dialogue and especially being in the public\u2019s eye is a positive thing,\u201d he said in an interview. Mondo Guerra Mexican-American fashion designer Mondo Guerra has been breaking barriers and stigmas regarding living with HIV ever since coming out as positive five years ago on Project Runway. While the 38-year-old Denver native is very open about living with HIV now, it wasn\u2019t always the case.\u201cIt was hard for me to have this revelation and tell my story because I was scared. I felt very ashamed. I was very embarrassed,\u201d he said in an interview and added, \u201cWhen I was diagnosed with HIV, I felt like I had failed, so it was very hard for me to talk about it.\u201d For latest Hollywood updates, follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain For the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain Danny Pintauro The child star of 80s sitcom Who\u2019s the boss, Pintauro was applauded after opening up about his HIV-positive diagnosis recently at Oprah\u2019s show.

Now it is his turn to give full support to Sheen, and he said, \u201cCharlie has made the right decision by sharing his truth. It took me 12 years to get to a place where I was ready to tell the world, but in all of that time I worried that someone else would want to tell my story without my permission, which is why I decided it was time to take control of my story and sit down with Oprah.

But unlike other carefree teenagers her age, this HIV-positive girl worries about her future: she fears that no healthy person would be willing to marry her. As a child, Kaveri lost her parents to AIDS, and ever since, has been under her grandmother's care. Seeing Kaveri married tops her aging grandma's priority list. But she faces a dilemma: even if she does find a match, the man would either be a widower or someone twice as old as Kaveri. \"These adolescent girls face a bleak future if they end up into forced marriages. More often than not, they are left with a single parent who wants to get them married quickly,\" says Saroja Putran, a member of the HIV-infected community. Such marriages are not a new phenomenon in rural parts of North Karnataka. Even Bangalore, which tops the list of districts with the highest HIV-positive population (25,000), is no exception to the practice. Parvathi, a widow who is HIV-positive, has big dreams for her 13-year-old daughter. \"I know it won't be easy for me to find a groom who's also HIV-positive. I want her to be well-educated and independent. I married an HIV-positive person and was infected. I've seen hell on earth and I don't want my daughter to go through the same,\" she rued. According to Fr Mathew Perumpil, director of Snehagram, a centre that provides free accommodation and vocation training to HIV-positive kids above 13 years of age, adolescent girls face multi-faceted problems. \"Caretakers want to get rid of their responsibilities as the child attains teenage. We've seen cases where the guardian insists on taking the child home, only to get her married. In one case, a 13-year-old girl was taken to Belgaum by her uncle. We later found out that she was sold for Rs 10,000. Even if the girls get married, they end up with HIV-positive men of their father's age. It's a social issue with many aspects,\" said Fr Mathew, who's been working on rehabilitating HIV-positive children for more than a decade. He is working on building a data centre that can help HIV-positive girls and boys find mates of their own age group.

        "body": "The Second International Conference on Alcohol and HIV, which was held recently at the India Habitat Centre, has called for multilevel community based approaches for combating pervasive alcohol use and the resulting HIV transmission. A special emphasis during the discussion was on gender norms. The researchers emphasised the need to produce greater gender equality and to shift norms that place aggression, violence and sexual exploitation within the masculine domain and are aggravated under the influence of alcohol. Ongoing research in different countries suggests that women\u2019s risk of gender-based and sexual violence is also increased by their partner\u2019s alcohol consumption. Therefore, without addressing gender issues, efforts to reduce alcohol-related sexual-risk behaviour might only be partly successful. Speaking at the conference, Dr Ravi Verma, regional director, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), said, \u201cGender is missing from many alcohol related as well as HIV related interventions. Interventions of any kind in the development sector must be conscientious of gender. Failure to do so may reinforce existing discrimination against women and girls.\u201d According to him, the majority of people who go for paid sex are problem drinkers and that they don\u2019t even use condoms. Some of the eminent researchers and subject experts who participated in the conference included Dr Kendall Bryant, director, Alcohol and HIV/AIDS Research, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Dr Jean J. Schensul, founding director, Institute for Community Research and Dr KS Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. The revelations of the studies presented by the key researchers prove that alcohol plays a direct and indirect role in promoting situations and decisions leading to unprotected sex with multiple partners in the general population and in vulnerable populations including mobile workers, and female sex workers, and those infected with HIV. The conference was organised by ICRW, in partnership with the Public Health Foundation of India, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Institute for Community Research. They had brought together programme specialists and researchers from India and neighbouring South Asian countries as well as US researchers working in India."

        "body": "RAIPUR: If data is any indication, HIV positive cases are on the rise among youth, particularly in the age group of 25 to 34 years, in Chhattisgarh. Of the 16,325 HIV positive cases detected in state, in last one decade (2003-to date), 39% fall in this age group. While men constitute a majority, 39% of these infected people are women and 8% are children under 14. As per figures provided by State AIDS Control Society (SACS), number of HIV positive cases has been rising consistently and considerably since 2003. The considerable rise is mainly due to increased awareness about the disease and the wide network of testing labs, which were almost non-existent till a decade ago. In 2003, the state on an average, recorded 3 cases per month, which went up to 125 in 2008 and stands at 252 cases as of date. The number of cases recorded per month in 2009 was 182, 190 in 2010, 213 in 2011 and 242 in 2012. According to the latest data of this fiscal (2013-14), the highest number of HIV positive cases was detected in Raipur, Durg and Bilaspur. Of the 9,825 people tested in Raipur, 466 were found to be HIV positive. Similarly, in Durg and Bilaspur, a total of 15,055 and 20,718 were tested and 298 and 288 were found HIV positive respectively. Talking to TOI, Kshitiz Diwan, SACS official, attributed the rise in number of cases to increased awareness and availability of testing centers. He said since 2008, testing centers have more than doubled from 52 to 111 in 2013. Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, said there is a need for people with HIV to lead a normal life and contribute to the society, regardless of their infection. He said almost 90 per cent of women get infected with HIV/AIDS from their husband. Thus, there is a dire need for behavioral control and attitude among men. At present, 5,069 people are taking treatment at ART centers. However, 11,782 people affected with AIDS were registered but more than 50% dropped the treatment midway."

National Aids Control Organisation and the health ministry said in 2009-10 India reported 2,711 such cases and the number of people affected with HIV due to blood transfusion have reduced over the past 15 years though the government continues to aim for zero transmission.The government's attempt to place the numbers in context came after NACO provided the statistics to an RTI query, which said 2,234 persons were infected with HIV while receiving blood transfusions in the 17 months under review.Officials also said the data is \"not scientific\" as it is based on subjective responses received from people visiting for HIV testing. \"There are several occasions when patients do not declare the exact reason or means of transmission because of societal pressure or even lack of awareness. Therefore, the data cannot be considered 100% accurate,\" a senior official at NACO said.However, the government maintained it is also working towards stringent blood safety screening procedures and to introduce technologies to ensure zero transmission. In India, NACO has been primarily responsible for ensuring transfer of safe blood.According to the 2015 annual report, till September 2014, NACO's total blood collection was around 30 lakh units. The total number of people living with HIV in India was estimated at around 20.9 lakh in 2011. Nearly 86% of these patients are in the 15-49 age-group. Children less than 15 years of age accounted for 1.45 lakh of all infections in 2011 while 39% were among women."

NHS England said the \u201csignificant patient recall\u201d has resulted from concerns over a dentist who treated patients in the Nottingham area. The dentist Desmond D'Mello used to work for the Daybrook Dental Surgery. The recall was sparked by concerns that D'Mello, who treated patients over a 32-year period, did not follow proper procedures. NHS England said that since June 2014, it has been working with Public Health England to investigate apparent breaches of infection control procedures by a single dentist, who was contracted to provide NHS dental services at the former Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottinghamshire. It said, \u201cOur investigation demonstrates that acceptable infection control standards do not appear to have been followed by Mr Desmond D\u2019Mello whilst he was treating patients at the former Daybrook Dental Practice. Immediate actions were taken to protect current patients once these apparent lapses were identified. However, this alleged drop in clinical standards may have put people at a low risk of blood born viruses like Hepatitis B, C and HIV. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we are advising all patients who have seen Mr D\u2019Mello to seek further advice on what action they may need to take\u201d. The investigation team has also consulted with clinical experts in Public Health England, who undertook a clinical analysis of the potential risk to patients. Mr D\u2019Mello has recently been tested by our Occupational Health Team and found to be clear of blood borne viruses. NHS said, \u201cBased on this clinical advice, Public Health England has recommended screening for all patients who have been treated by Mr D\u2019Mello. It is understood the number of patients affected who have been seen and treated by Mr D\u2019Mello during his time at the former Daybrook Dental Practice is about 22,000, as he had worked at the practice for over 32 years\u201d."

        "body": "MYSORE: After learning that she had contracted AIDS in 2005, this mother of two children attempted suicide thrice. But today, her outlook towards AIDS has changed -- she is determined to fight the killer virus so she can live longer. The 39-year-old Mysorean is one among 16,000 persons living with AIDS. In the past two years, she has changed four houses as their owners forced her to vacate after coming to know of her trauma. \"I suffer because of the stigma attached to AIDS, but my son, daughter and community members are my strength,\" she said. \"Eight years ago, I fell sick and became very weak. I was admitted to a government hospital, where I was subjected to various tests, except for HIV. But in a test at a private lab a year later, I got to know that I had contracted HIV. I sunk into depression. My father and brother consoled me, but they started avoiding me a month later,\" she added. \"In the meantime, I attempted suicide twice by consuming tablets, but survived. When I was in hospital, I decided to end my life by jumping from the building. But again, my sister stopped me. And my husband, from whom I contracted this, left me with two children,\" she explained. \"During the initial year, I struggled with little children. I used to crawl on the staircase to reach the ART centre at KR Hospital for treatment. But after meeting the community members, I mustered confidence - their stories made me fight. My son and daughter, aged 16 and 11 respectively, are studying in a school,\" she said, adding: \"A person with HIV can lead a normal life if (s)he is optimistic. I'm living like any other normal person today. It was possible because of regular treatment, counselling and healthy lifestyle.\" She urged the government to create more awareness among the public about AIDS, and also facilitate infected persons with housing and other facilities."

        "body": "MUMBAI: In a move that will disappoint many patients, the government has withdrawn certain powers of the drug pricing regulator that allowed it to cap prices of widely prescribed anti-diabetes, cancer, HIV, tuberculosis and cardiac medicines. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said it is withdrawing \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d \u2014 a guideline that had allowed it to put price caps on crucial medicines \u2014 to comply with a government \u201cdirection\u201d. The guideline had been issued on May 29, just three days after the Modi government was sworn in. Although the NPPA\u2019s sudden notification does not mention whether it is revoking the price caps which it had announced on 50 anti-diabetic and cardiac drugs in July, the development could have negative fallout, sources said. A wider and more serious impact will be that impending price controls on expensive treatments of cancer, HIV and tuberculosis now stand cancelled. READ ALSO: Stock-out hits HIV treatment across India NPPA officials were not available for comment, but sources say the government succumbed to pressure from industry lobbies. The NPPA\u2019s decision to impose price controls had been hotly contested; with the industry up in arms against what it said was \u201carbitrary implementation of the policy\u201d. In effect, NPPA has withdrawn guidelines for price control issued under Para 19 of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013, which authorized it to control prices of drugs that are not under the NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d and in \u201cpublic interest\u201d. In July the NPPA, in a rare invocation of the lesser-used provision, had fixed prices of 50 anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medicines. This was the first time the government had brought drugs, outside the national list of essential medicines, under price control. (Prices of 652 drugs under NLEM were fixed by the government last year under DPCO 2013). The move had triggered of a series of protests and lawsuits from the industry against the drug pricing regulator as they feared more such action. \u201cIn compliance with the directions received from the government in the department of pharmaceuticals ... The aforesaid internal guidelines issued by the NPPA on May 29, 2014 under Paragraph 19 of DPCO 2013 are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect,\u201d NPPA said in its latest notification posted on its website. The industry welcomed the move saying that the interpretation of the May guidelines was erroneous. \u201cWe have always contended that the guidelines for Para 19 were erroneous. Para 19 is not the right provision for extension of price control as there is no public health concern which could have prompted the NPPA to invoke the provision,\u201d D G Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said. Though it is still trying to figure out its implication on companies, the industry body representing multinational firms, the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, said: \u201cWe appreciate the government\u2019s decision to withdraw the guidelines on fixation/revision of prices of scheduled and non-scheduled formulations under Para 19 of the DPCO 2013. This welcome move tells us we are being heard and we look forward to working with the government toward a common goal.\u201d The industry expects that the NPPA will take a decision on whether to revoke the price reduction order, over the next few days. The next hearing of the OPPI court case against NPPA is slated for September 29."

Ranjan, who is in jail since November 14, is said to have been arrested for demanding adequate allocation of drugs at the 10 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in the state. The demonstrators claimed that the ART centres lacked sufficient doctors. They accused the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) of ill-treating the HIV positive people. There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 55,000 are HIV positive. The largest numbers of HIV positive people are in Patna district. There are 207 integrated counselling and testing centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled accordingly. Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements for HIV/AIDS tests at every health centre across the state. BNP+ members from UP, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan participated in the demonstration. Supreme Court lawyer Anand Grover termed the arrest of Ranjan a clear violation of fundamental rights to speech. \"Continued denial of basic medicines and services to HIV positive people is a denial of the fundamental rights to them,\" said Manoj Pardeshi from New Delhi. Secretary, BNP+, Raj Kumar Singh said not only doctors do not come to the ART centres, even basic paediatric medicines are not available for the children found HIV positive. Sunita from Muzaffarpur said she has to travel 35kms to the ART centre for drug. She complained that drug is available only after 4-5 days of her visit. \"How can I manage with this,\" she said. Naresh Yadav of International treatment preparedness coalition of India (ITPC-India), New Delhi, said Ranjan's arrest speaks of Emergency-like situation where the government wants to suppress all the dissenting voice. This is happening in the backdrop of the state government's announcement of a slew of measures for people with HIV\\AIDS in the state which include starting pension scheme for them and providing employment. Pension scheme was announced by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi while inaugurating an awareness exhibition on HIV/AIDS on the Red Ribbon Express, in Patna, in September this year. The government feels grant of pension will embolden people living with AIDS or HIV positive."

In the last 10 months (till October 31, 2015), the district officially recorded 160 positive cases of AIDS, including 100 men and 60 women. In 2014, 99 men and 45 women were found infected with the virus. A slight decline had been seen in the number of cases over the past three years. The district had recorded 198 positive cases in 2012. In 2013, that number had gone down to 145, with a further decline recorded in 2014, when 144 people were found positive. However, the number of cases has gone up this year, crossing the 160 mark in October. \"We get people from all backgrounds. There are labourers as well as college and school students. We've witnessed a rise in number of youngsters coming for counselling. Despite awareness about the virus, most of them don't go for safe sex, constantly indulging in unsafe sex instead,\" said a counsellor at one of the centres on condition of anonymity. Dr Vijay Kumar, nodal officer for AIDS and TB in the district, though, felt the centre has been successful in bringing down AIDS cases, keeping in mind the city's rapidly increasing population. \"We've been regularly conducting awareness programmes in school, colleges and public places via street plays and discussions. There has been a marginal increase, reflected in the number of people, especially women, coming for counselling sessions. It's also compulsory to conduct HIV test of all pregnant women approaching government hospitals nowadays. This could be a reason for the spike in the number of infected women,\" he told TOI. He added the centre is also working with NGOs that are in touch with the city's migrant population and high-risk groups. While 26,138 people approached the centre for counselling till October 31, 2015, the centre had witnessed a footfall of 30,752 people last year. In 2012 and 2013, 22,932 and 27,576 people respectively, had visited the centre for counselling. The district's first ICTC centre was opened in Civil Hospital in 2002. Now, there are six such centres in the state, including ones in Alawa, Pataudi, Heli Mandi, Sohna and Farrukhnagar. There are two more facilities - one in District TB Centre of Civil Hospital, the other in Wazirabad."

Second, barely a few hours after letting him in on his condition, he was told to move out of the hospital. Later, he was admitted to Hamidia hospital where his condition is critical. He is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and TB meningitis, a condition which affects central nervous system, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in charge Dr Hemant Verma. A resident of Oriya Basti area, he was admitted to intensive care unit of People's medical college hospital on July 1. \"After he was diagnosed HIV positive on Wednesday evening, hospital constantly asked his relatives to take him away to the ART centre.

His treatment can be carried out at ART centre only,\" said People's medical hospital additional medical superintendent Dr R G Agarwal, when asked if on humanitarian grounds the patient could have been treated longer at the private hospital. Dr Agarwal said, \"He is suffering from HIV and unless (ART) treatment is not started the HIV positive patient would not recover.\" Efforts to contact People's medical hospital Dean Dr VP Pandya were in vain as he did not respond to queries. However, contradicting views of People's hospital doctor, Dr Verma said, \"ART treatment in such condition would be detrimental to patient's health.\" \"Considering that the patient was critical, his condition should have been stabilized, before discharge.

        "body": "NEW DELHI: A vaginal gel can now protect women against HIV infection -- an innovation that scientists believe could be most crucial for reproductive health since the Pill. On Tuesday, scientists announced at the International Aids Conference in Vienna that they have successfully tested a gel, containing antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, which is usually taken as a tablet by HIV patients. The drug can reduce a woman's chances of contracting HIV from an infected partner by 50% if used 12 hours before and after having sex. Interestingly, the gel had undergone a safety and acceptability trial on 100 women at National Aids Research Institute (NARI) in Pune in 2007. It can also reduce the risk of genital herpes by 51%. Being hailed as a major breakthrough globally, the CAPRISA trial followed 900 HIV-negative, sexually active South African women in the age group between 18 and 40. Two-and-a-half-years on, researchers found the gel reduced chances of HIV infection by 50% after a year and 39% after 30 months. The study revealed that those women -- who used the drug consistently nearly 80% of the time before having sex -- would be 54% less prone to infection. Health secretary K Sujatha Rao told TOI \"This is a major breakthrough, and will especially benefit India's 300,000-strong sex worker community involved in multi-partner sex. It will also help women who usually do not have the power to insist on condom use and fidelity, or to abandon partnerships that put them at high risk.\" K Chandramouli, director general of National Aids Control Organisation. added, \"At present, India has 2.7 million HIV patients. We also record 1.7 lakh fresh cases of HIV every year, nearly 40% of which are women. Such a microbicide, once ready for implementation in our programme, will greatly benefit women.\" According to NARI director Dr R S Paranjape, the gel underwent safety and acceptability study in India as well. \"The preparatory work for the CAPRISA trial was conducted here along with the Microbicide Trials Network. The overall safety profile of the gel was good and it was well accepted by women. Presently, it provides 40% protection. The scientific community will now look at increasing this percentage,\" he explained. With a vaccine against HIV remaining elusive, scientists have for the past 20 years been looking for such an effective microbicide -- products such as gels, films, rings or creams that women could apply on their vagina to prevent HIV transmission. Finally, the breakthrough has happened, thanks to the microbicide that contains 1% Tenofovir. Tenofovir gel is an advanced second-generation HIV-specific microbicide that neither tries to kill the AIDS virus nor block it from entering the body as its predecessors. Instead, it is designed to prevent the virus from replicating when it comes in contact with an uninfected T-cell. Naturally, the virus will fail to survive for long to cause systemic infection. Women, who constitute 50% all new HIV cases globally, are also twice as likely as their male partners to contract HIV during unsafe sex. \"Tenofovir gel could fill an important HIV prevention gap by empowering women who are unable to successfully negotiate mutual faithfulness or condom use with their male partners,\" said study co- principal investigator Dr Quarraisha Abdool Karim. \"Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates. Tenofovir gel has a potential dual effect in preventing HIV. Since women with genital herpes are much more likely to become infected with HIV, the additional protection of tenofovir gel against herpes creates a second mechanism whereby the gel may have a bigger impact in preventing HIV,\" he explained. The gel is undergoing another Microbicide Trials Networks VOICE -- Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic -- study that will provide evidence about the safety and efficacy of tenofovir gel used daily, irrespective of when participants have sex. Once this study is conducted, drug regulatory authorities will determine if the gel is safe and effective for HIV prevention. It may take another two years before public can use it. Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, \"For the first time, we have seen results for a woman-initiated and controlled HIV prevention option.\""

But now the decision has been taken to keep the identity of the patients confidential. The RSRTC is issuing smart cards for all the 34 categories, which could avail the concession facilities while travelling in roadways buses. Vishram Meena, RSRTC executive director said, \"The passes which will be issued to PLHIV, will not have HIV written in them. In all the passes, the category of the persons availing the benefit will be mentioned on the smart cards, but in case of PLHIV, there will be no mention of HIV in the smart cards.\" Moreover, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) claimed that one PLHIV needs to travel for around 18 times per year to get medicines between Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centers and the patient's home. The RSRTC provides 75% concession on fare for travel. At the ART centers, the PLHIV get medicines free of cost that are provided by the RSACS. A person with HIV said, \"There are incidences when our identity is revealed. The conductors also inquire a lot when they see HIV written on the card.\" On one occasion, the RSRTC suspended one conductor for disclosing the identity of the PLHIV. The patient added that now if the RSRTC has decided not to disclose the identity of the PLHIV the people like her welcome the step. In Rajasthan, there are at least 14,000 PLHIV, who visit ART centers for medicines every month."

        "body": "TULLURU (GUNTUR): The promise of big bucks and a certain eagerness to give up the farming way of life is what contributed to a majority of the farmers in the proposed capital region of Andhra Pradesh giving up their land to the state. As of Monday , the state has secured consent letters from farmers for 22,220 acres for the construction of the capital as against the target of 30,000 acres. Apparently, as many as 12,343 of the 20,000 farmers in the region have given their consent. With the state extending the deadline to give consent to February 28, AP officials were confident that the remaining 8,000 acres needed would be acquired by then. \u201cThis is the biggest land pooling exercise in the country . All the land pooled so far is private land, no government land has been acquired,\u201c Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) commissioner N Srikanth told TOI. Majority of the farmers from Tulluru village cited many reasons for agreeing to part with their land. One was a wish to quit the hard toil of farming while another was the promise of a large lump sum of money . \u201cI am 38 years old now, I work hard day and night in the field and can expect money to only trickle in. Now, I am being offered a chance to make quick bucks and want to cash in on it,\u201c Kranti, a farmer from Tulluru, said. Like Kranti, most farmers hardly needed much persuasion to part with their land. What seems to guide many is the tantalizing hope of clearing their debts and starting life anew. \u201cI have piled up huge debts and am unable to marry off my children. Now, I hope to do so,\u201c said Raghunath Rao, a farmer from Krishnayapalem. Another reason for wanting to bid goodbye to farming is that their children have taken to other professions.Sources said the children of many farmers have moved to Vijayawada or Hyderabad or even abroad. As a result, with no helping hands, at least 15 per cent of land owners here have given their land to tenant farmers for cultivation.\u201cMany farmers told us that their children want them to give up farming and move to the cities to lead a retired life,\u201c revenue officials said. Yet another reason for the farmers to part with their land is that they belong to the Kamma community and are traditional supporters of the TDP . Of the 26 villages where the land pooling exercise is on, nearly 18 of them are dominated by the Kamma community . But the battle is far from over for the state. While Tulluru and a few other villages have given their consent, many others are hardly willing to. This means that getting the remaining 8,000 acres will not be easy."

        "body": "NAGPUR: Increasingly large numbers of children are falling prey to HIV passed on to them from their parents. Most of them are orphans even before the age of five. Keeping them alive despite availability of good medicines is quite a task that usually falls on the grandparents. Even with their own health dwindling and no financial support, they are still determined to do their best until they are alive. Big question, however, is what after them? Mamta Godghate, 70, and grandmother of 13-year-old Satyajeet (all names changed), whose parents died when he was just three, narrates the spine chilling story of she working day in and out as a daily wager breaking stones for road making to earn daily bread for her grandson and her sick husband. Tears roll down her cheeks but her words are full of determination. \"I know I am old but I will strive for my grandson till my last breath. It is my duty. I will make him strong enough to take life in his stride before I die,\" she says. There were many grandparents sharing similar stories at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Tuesday during a programme organized by the medicine department's ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre to felicitate children living with HIV/AIDS and encourage them to continue taking medicines and bring a feeling of belongingness in them. Sushma Kathare, grandmother of Kumar who works as farm labourer in Waddhamna, brings her grandson religiously to GMCH once a month. \"Medicines are free but sometimes I don't have money for even the bus ride. I have to borrow but I don't let him miss medicine,\" she said. Aunt of 10-year-old Natisha was thrown out of her own house by her sons for bringing up a HIV positive child but is determined to give him good education. Though their caretakers may be worried, the children are mostly unaware of the gravity of their own disease. They are aware they are HIV-positive and need medication regularly to survive. \"I did not take medicines regularly. My parents died, so I lived for sometime with my uncles. They didn't take me to hospital and said I deserved to die. I am now living in an orphanage. Now I am on second line of ART only because I discontinued the medicines,\" said 13-year-old Kshitij who came alone for the programme. There were two other boys who also had come alone but were being brought up by their grandparents. GMCH dean Dr Rajaram Powar, medicine head Dr Y B Bansod, ART Centre senior medical officer Dr Megha Navade, centre counsellor Preeti Kadu, and the chief guest Raje Sangram Singh Bhosale, city businessman Kishor Rathi and Tanuja Sheware felicitated the children and gave them blankets, books, balls and toys."

        "body": "CHANDIGARH: Rohtak has earned the dubious distinction of being the district with highest number of full-blown AIDS cases in Haryana. According to data compiled by Haryana AIDS Control Society (HACS) in October last year, Haryana has a total of 2,495 AIDS patients and 566 of them are in Rohtak alone. After Rohtak, Jind has the second highest number of 322 AIDS patients followed by Sonipat and Jhajjar with 318 and 309, respectively. In 2001, Haryana had a total of 218 AIDS patients. Alarmed by the rise in AIDS cases, the Haryana government has decided to open four more anti-retro-viral treatment centres in Karnal, Agroha and Mewat and Faridabad districts. HACS additional director Vijay Garg said, \"The Rohtak figure could be high. But it doesn't mean that all are residents of Rohtak district. Since PGIMS is situated at Rohtak which is the only anti-retro-viral treatment centre, the figure includes patients visiting the PGIMS.\" \"No doubt the figures have increased in the state. But prevalence is quite low in the state. Situation is under control if you compare the figures of past two years,\" he added."

        "body": "A strange smell of medicine permeates the air when Muniyammal (50) turned the pages of her antiviral treatment record. The 200-page notebook has details of her treatment from the day she tested HIV positive. Five years ago, when her husband Raman, a rabbit-hunter, died due to AIDS-related illness what he left was a ruined house and five children. Muniyammal somehow managed to get a loan from the bank and renovated the house. Adding fuel to the fire, she was tested positive two years after her husband's death. The couple's sons left their mother once they got to know about her status. Now, with bouts of TB attack, Muniyammal has to take care of her two daughters, Pachammal (13) and Meenammal (11). Muniyammal's is not a lone case, there are many like her in the Achapatti Street in Kariapatti, a panchayat town near Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district. Kariapatti has a population of 1.65 lakh. The number of HIV cases is increasing in this village due to various reasons. In 2008, there were only 17 HIV cases recorded, but in 2009 it rose to 55 and in 2010, it went to 58. There are 22 discordant couples in Kariapatti area alone. At least 45 people have been tested positive so far this year. There are three main reasons for the increased rate of HIV incidents in Kariapatti, according to Mercy Annapurni of the Blossom Trust, an NGO based in Virudhunagar. \"There is a sizable population of masons who go to Mumbai, Tirupur and Coimbatore for temporary works and return with the virus. Since Kariapatti is the town for all the other villages, transgenders from other places come in groups and camp in the town for commercial sex. The drivers of trucks passing by this area during night halt near Ramu Seethai Polytechnic in Manthiriodai for sex. The place has become a high-risk area now,\" says Annapurni. Vadivammal Kamala, another villager says she knew about her status only after her husband's death. Living alone in an old house without any proper income, none of her four children visit their mother. Frustrated, the 49-year-old even skips her medicine. And this, according to health-worker Muthulakshmy, is a serious problem. \"Social stigma prevents many from having medicines on time. If the patients are aged, then the level of frustration they are undergoing will be high. Many even skip their medicines due to this. We have to monitor each and every one,\" says Muthulakshmy, who has been working for the welfare of the villagers for 10 years. Even though none of the children of Muniyammal and Kamala Meenakshi did not test HIV positive for HIV as both the mothers contracted the disease from their husbands, in the later stages of their life, Rajam was unlucky. She was not aware of her status until she gave birth to her daughter. Staying in a rented house, she struggles to meet the day's end. \"I don't have a regular income. My daughter is studying. I don't know how to survive,\" she says. Despite being a high-risk area, the village also suffers from several a lot of civic issues. Drinking water, according to the villagers, reaches them once in a week. \"We get drinking water only once in a week. Our drainage is choked. Even though the previous government promised us houses, it has not been materialized so far,\" says Munisamy, a villager. However, talking to TOI, a panchayat official said, \"We are conducing regular health-check up for the HIV positive people in all the villages in Kariapatti. Free medicines are given to them. We will definitely look into the civic issues,\" says the official, who didn't want to be named. (Names of the victims have been changed to protect their identity)"

In a rare surgery, a team of gastroenterologists, using laparoscopic technology, replaced the HIV-positive man\u2019s damaged food pipe with a fold of his stomach. Doctors generally hesitate before performing any kind of complicated surgeries on HIV positive or clinical AIDS patients because their immune systems are usually highly compromised. \u201cIt\u2019s risky. If the vein near the food pipe gets damaged, it\u2019s almost instant death. This new tube itself may develop a leak, which could lead to death. They are highly prone to infections and the patient finds it difficult to recover post-surgery,\u201d said Dr J S Rajkumar of Lifeline. The operating team also puts themselves under risk when using the laparoscopic machine on a HIV-positive person. \u201cWe have a separate ward for them. The instruments can never be reused and the blood touching the skin or the sharp instruments poking us could be very dangerous,\u201d he added. The procedure was done by making three holes on the side of the chest, four holes in the abdomen and a cut in the neck. \u201cWe inserted the thoracolaparascopic equipment inside, removed the damaged esophagus, and then separated the layers of the stomach, and pulled out a part of it, to make a tube out of it, and tied it up at the neck,\u201d said Dr Rajkumar. Ravirajan was diagnosed with HIV in 2000. Five years ago, his food pipe almost closed. He could not take solid food. \u201cMy throat would get blocked even if I had porridge. Then I would vomit it out,\u201d said Ravirajan. His food pipe kept narrowing and had to be dilated. After nearly 22 such dilations, Ravirajan lost all hope of eating. And then he walked into the hospital for the surgery in April."

The patient, a 50-year-old man who had arrived from Giridih district on Thursday morning with a urine retention problem, died in the casualty ward of Rims within an hour as the hospital allegedly did not admit the patient. The kin of the patient alleged that despite being referred an emergency surgery, the hospital management did not admit him. However, the Rims management claimed he was admitted and died before being taken to the surgery unit. \u201cThe patient came in at 11.45am with urine retention problem. The doctor on duty in the casualty ward then referred him to the surgery unit for an emergency operation, but he died,\u201d Rims director Dr B L Sherwal said on Thursday evening. \u201cHe was certainly admitted, but there could have been a slack in medical attention,\u201d Sherwal added. The Rims management has ordered an enquiry and constituted a three-member probe committee, comprising one professor each from the medicine and surgery departments and one medical officer and directed the submission of the report in three days. This is the third alleged case of negligence towards HIV patients in this month. While an HIV positive patient was handed a wrong report from a private diagnostic centre early this week, another positive patient was denied admission earlier this month. \u201cThe consecutive reports have come as a cause of deep concern for us. We are not going to tolerate such negligence in the future,\u201d Sherwal added."

K Radhakrishnan (41), his wife R Kanchana (36), their two daughters and two nieces escaped, some of them with minor injuries. Radhakrishnan said in his complaint that Thirumani panchayat president V Rajagopal, who wanted the family to vacate the village because of the couple\u2019s HIV positive status, was behind the incident. Police have registered a case of attempt to murder, but have not arrested anyone. \"What wrong did we do?\" wailed Kanchana, when TOI visited the couple on Sunday. \"We were thrown out of our rented houses in Chengalpet many times after the owners came to know that we were HIV positive.\" Radhakrishnan said the group locked the house from outside and set fire to it at 2.30 am on Thursday because he refused to listen to the village leaders\u2019 diktat that they go away from the village. Radhakrishnan and his wife R Kanchana work as coordinators for the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. They were fast asleep, along with four children when they realised the house was on fire. Radhakrishnan sustained injuries on his forehead and arms and his two-year-old daughter R Jemimu suffered bruises on her abdomen while trying to get out of the house on fire. The injured were taken to the Chengalpet Medical College Hospital and discharged in a day. The couple now live with a relative in Chengalpet without police protection. Radhakrishnan said he woke up early in the morning and saw flames engulfing the thatched roof. He tried to open the door, but it was latched from outside. When the couple cried for help, some neighbours came to their rescue. \"The stigma should end. Most families have a person with some aliment. It is not proper to isolate HIV positive people just because they have infection,\" said S Nandakumar, a neighbour who helped put out the fire. Not many in the village echo Nandakumar\u2019s sentiments. Panchayat president V Rajagopal, who has been named in the FIR as a suspect, is among those opposed to the family living in the village. When approached by TOI, Rajagopal denied that any such incident happened in the village. \"To my knowledge, no house was burnt,\" said Rajagopal."

A collaborative research would be undertaken by the renowned scientist from the University and their counterparts from AU. The research would be initiated by professor Bechan Sharma, department of biochemistry, AU and prof Tobias Restle, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Lubeck, Germany. The research work would be conducted for period of two months starting from mid May. Prof Sharma, while talking to TOI gave a detailed information about the research. He said, \" The joint efforts would be focused on investigating the new anti HIV-1 drug which has the potential to terminate the replication of the dreaded virus. Simultaneously, their joint endeavour would explore the molecular intricacies involved in the HIV-1 RT, the key enzyme responsible for generation of mutations in HIV-1 genome. The outcome of the research would enable the development of safe and cost effective anti HIV-1 drugs. Prof Sharma said that the existing drugs have certain shortcomings including high costs, side effects and toxicity that develop after prolonged usage of the drugs. As soon as the structural changes in the virus are identified, an effective antidote could be developed as precise understanding of the behaviour of the virus. This would enhance the future preparation of the drug. Detailing further about various interesting facts pertaining to this dreaded disease, Prof Sharma said that AIDS continues to spread unchecked since its first documentation in 1981. Two decades later, nearly 50 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS world wide and approximately 25 million had died, according to figures released by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO). India shares 10 per cent of global HIV burden and 65 per cent of South-East Asian population. It is reported that 5.2 million HIV infections exist in India. The national HIV prevalence was between 0.4 and 1.3 percent HIV-1 in 2003."

The girl from Thrissur was diagnosed with dextrocardia (condition in which your heart points toward the right side of your chest instead of the left side). She was also suffering from abnormal positions of left and right ventricles and two holes on the wall of the heart (ventricular septum) leading to a dip in oxygen level in her blood. The 3D printing technology helped them create the replica of her heart in its real size and features. Amritha, daughter of auto driver Dinesh Babu and Anitha, was diagnosed with multiple heart disorders when she was an infant. \"Dextrocardia is a rare condition. The girl's ventricles were in superior-inferior (one on the top of the other) relationship unlike the normal right side-left side positioning. She had two holes in the heart's wall. Moreover, the aorta which carries pure blood to different parts of the body was connected to the right ventricle which contains impure blood. So, the blood supplied to her body was a mix of pure and impure,\" said paediatric cardiology professor Dr Mahesh, who heads 3D printing lab of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Kochi. Moreover, there was a block in the pulmonary artery carrying blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation. The girl underwent two life-saving surgeries - Glenn shunt and BT shunt - as an infant which helped her gain an oxygen saturation of up to 85%. In July 2018, the doctors conducted complex surgeries to fix the holes in her heart's wall and ensure pure blood flow to aorta. \"We took the 3D images of the girl's heart and made a real-size replica. A team of doctors - including US-based Indian cardiologist Dr Mohan Reddy and AIMS paediatric cardiologist Dr Krishna Kumar studied it. We then conducted a mock surgery on the model heart. This helped us reduce the time required for the surgery, acquire precision and avoid complications,\" said Dr Brijesh Kottayil, consultant cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, AIMS, Kochi. The surgery, costing Rs 3 lakh, was conducted with financial support from Genesis Foundation, an NGO that facilitates treatment for critically ill and underprivileged children with heart disorders. \"The condition of our daughter has improved a lot. The bluish colour in her body has disappeared,\" said Babu, who was in the hospital with her daughter to attend the first consultation scheduled two months after the surgery."

In fact they can help in more ways. A team of scientists from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has developed an application that serves this purpose and also offers the elderly a choice to \u2018slow down\u2019 a normal talk to take in the details. And it\u2019s aptly named VOW (Voice Wrapping). The application developed by Prof Chandra Shekar Seelamantula and his team from the department of electrical engineering uses digital signal processing which is at the heart of most electronic gadgets. In simpler words, it regulates the speed of the speech heard. So, a person with hearing disability or seeking to learn pronunciation can slow down the speech to grasp the details. Chandra Shekar, who developed VOW along with Sunil R and Aditya Vasisht, told TOI that the technology has a wide range of applications. \u201cIt can help children and people with speaking disabilities properly articulate and pick up the correct pronunciation for a word. The technique also gives the elderly and the hearing-impaired a choice to \u2018slow down\u2019 a normal talk, and perceive the details,\u201d he told TOI. At the base of the application is how humans speak and sing with the help of vocal apparatus \u2014 comprising mainly the lungs, glottis, vocal folds, vocal tract, oral, and nasal cavities. Every word we speak starts off as a train of puffs of air released by lungs. These packets of air, on their way up, hit the voice box, and make it to vibrate about a few hundred times per second. The vibrations produce a feeble sound, which is strengthened by the throat, nose, and mouth. Easy connect VOW\u2019s output quality is superior to other techniques and it\u2019s language is independent, so it\u2019s easy to integrate it into most standard media players such as Windows Media Player and Quick Time Player; voice over internet applications (VoIP) such as Skype, VQube and Google Talk; text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) applications such as iPhone Siri, and tablet-based dictation tools. Hassle-free dubbing This technology can be used in dubbing too. Artistes go for several takes to get the lip movement and the voice in sync. The task of getting the lip sync is tiresome and time consuming at times. This technology can do away with re-takes. A mathematical model that\u2019s been developed allows technicians to get the right lip sync with one voice recording. Quote We plan to develop VOW apps for smartphones so that it becomes more accessible to a wider section of people. We will also try to customize our technology to specific applications. \u2014 Prof Chandra Shekar Seelamantula | Faculty DEE & Head of Spectrum Lab, IISc"

These HIV positive children are under the North 24-Parganas Network for People living with HIV/AIDS, Barasat (NNP+), who facilitates their health check-ups, treatment and other support. Majority of these children got infected from their parents while few are thalassemic and got the virus during blood transfusions. Most are orphans as their parents have succumbed to AIDS. \u201cThere are about 400 children under NNP+, many of whom have lost their parents to AIDS. Their families do not want to keep them due to the stigma. And so far there is no shelter home for these children from the government. But this effort by the staff and students of the nursing college is a reason to cheer for these children,\u201d said Samir Biswas of NNP + Barasat.

Principal Dr Subrata Sarkar hugged the children, shook hands and mixed with them, sending a message to students that HIV positive individuals are not to be shunned. \u201cThere is still so much of stigma attached with HIV positives. Such interaction, apart from giving the HIV positive kids a little bit of joy during the festival, is also a platform where we make an effort to change the attitude of the future nurses about these patients,\u201d said Sarkar.

        "body": "NAGPUR: A dispute over payment of just Rs 2 crore has held up second line treatment of hundreds of AIDS patients across India putting their life at risk. The treatment is held up for six months as most government centres do not have viral load testing kits. kits are supplied through National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) that buys it from Roche Diagnostics India Ltd (RDIL). RDIL has stopped the supply since January 2013 as NACO failed to make payments worth Rs 2 crore. As many as 100 patients of second line of antiretroviral therapy (ART) from Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in city have been asked to wait until the kits arrive. These are not just HIV positive patients. They are patients on whom the first line of ART has failed and need second line regime. The only centre in Maharashtra that tests the viral load of patients (actual amount of HIV in patient's blood), Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, does not have the kits since January. All government medical colleges with second line of ART facility send their patients to Grant Medical College and J J Hospital in Mumbai which collects the blood and sends sample to Kasturba Hospital. When TOI tried to contact the authorities at J J as well as Kasturba hospitals, everyone deflected the queries to someone else. TOI then contacted director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) Prakash Sabde who demanded a formal questionnaire through mail. Even after being sent one, he did not respond to email and repeated requests. A reliable source in NACO, Delhi, clarified that actually kits were available. It is the reagents required for tests that are not. NACO buys them from RDIL but has not made payment for the past two years. Strangely, reagents are procured for NACO through RITES, a subsidiary of Indian railways. \"We can't even buy them from other agencies as the testing machines are bought from RDIL and come with a rider that the user has to buy the reagents from the same company. The payment was stopped since documentation by vendor was not proper. Now we have made some part payments, so RDIL has resumed supply from April-May. It will be some time before each centre gets supplies,\" said the source. Meanwhile, senior medical officer of ART centre at GMCH Dr Megha Navade said the waiting list was continuing to swell. The problem was not limited just to GMCH. Pune and Aurangabad colleges which were the only other two centres with second line of ART facility too were facing the same problem. \"We have written to authorities in Mumbai many times but we are told not to send patients until kits arrive,\" she said. No aid for aids patients * GMCH is only centre for second line of ART treatment in Vidarbha. * Patients whose CD4 count does not increase despite regular medication with first line of drugs are tested for second line of ART. * Their treatment is put on hold till viral load is assessed. This is done only at Mumbai. Patient's blood cannot be sent to Mumbai. They have to travel to give samples at JJ Hospital. * Such patients are stuck because testing has stopped owing to non-supply of kits/reagents. * Supply stopped because of payment dispute with supplier."

        "body": "LONDON: One of the world\u2019s most feared virus is losing its edge. HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study led by British scientists. The team at the University of Oxford has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause AIDS. The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients\u2019 natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus\u2019s ability to cause AIDS. The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly \u2014 in other words the virus becomes less virulent \u2014 because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic. Scientists said: \u201cTwenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.\u201d In 2013, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The study was led by researchers at the University of Oxford, along with scientists from South Africa, Canada, Tokyo, Harvard University and Microsoft Research. Schoolgirls take part in an HIV/AIDS awareness rally on World AIDS Day at a School in Patiala, on December 1, 2014. READ ALSO: Four south Indian states make up 50% of HIV cases Lead scientist Professor Phillip Goulder from the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThis research highlights the fact that HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate. Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.\u201d Bill Clinton, former US president, addresses the crowd at a musical concert organized to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS on World AIDS day in New York City, on December 1, 2014. The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study. The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body\u2019s natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent. READ ALSO: Medicines, test kit scarcity hits HIV therapy in India Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called HLA-B57, are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV. Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS. College and Schoolstudents hold a giant red ribbon made by themselves during an event to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS on the World AIDS Day, in Fuyang, China, on December 1, 2014. This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene\u2019s protective effect. However, the team\u2019s data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent. The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination. In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate."

        "body": "CHENNAI: City police on Monday arrested a 34-year-old HIV positive man for allegedly raping a 23-year-old woman in Padi New Town near Anna Nagar West. The woman has undergone emergency medical procedures to prevent infection. Blood samples of the accused have been sent for HIV testing. According to police, the accused, a construction worker living on Fifth Street in Padi New Town, has been undergoing treatment for AIDS at the government general hospital for the last two years. He was friendly with his neighbour Swamy (name changed), a driver who was living with his wife Rani (name changed). Swamy was admitted to Madras Medical Mission hospital with a heart condition last week. The police said the accused jumped over the wall separating his house from Swamy's, where Rani (23) was alone, 11:30pm on Sunday. He knocked on the door and asked for some help. He suddenly barged into the house and seizing Rani by her throat, he started threatening her at knife point, the police said. \"Rani tried to flee from his grip, but he grabbed her sleeping child and said he would kill the baby if she didn't cooperate,\" a police officer said. The police said that accused had planned the whole crime. He knew that the victim was staying alone. \"He raped the woman twice during the night,\" the officer said. Before leaving, he told Rani that he would kill her and the baby if she went to the police. On Monday morning, Rani went to JJ Nagar police station and filed a case. Based on her complaint, police registered a case of rape and started searching for the accused. Getting information that he was at the local bus stop drinking tea, the police nabbed him at 9:30am. Investigations revealed that he was being treated for HIV. The accused told the police that he contracted HIV from using contaminated needles for drug use. Police collected his blood samples and sent them for a Eliza test. Police also rushed Rani to GH where she was given two anti-retroviral shots to prevent HIV infection, P Subramaniam, inspector of police at JJ Nagar station told TOI. These shots have to be given at least 72 hours after exposure. Rani's blood samples have also been sent for HIV test. Rani and the accused were produced before the Ambattur magistrate court for further directions. The court remanded the accused in judicial custody for 15 days. Rani will be sent for forensic examination."

The cast and crew of the film were also felicitated at the HIV Congress held in Goa. The film addresses the hopes and failures of the couples affected by HIV. While there have been many awareness generation films, this one specifically educates people of the possibility of HIV victims having their own uninfected babies. The film addresses to the bigger motive. It speaks out loud that there can be bigger problems than HIV and all that is needed to handle the problems is courage and support of your people. 'There will be Tomorrow' is written and directed by Bhushan Gaur, who has made several ad films and documentaries internationally for over 10 years and is an alumni of New York Film Academy.

It had also blocked cities and counties from passing protections for people from LGBT community. Despite the changes, there are criticism that still some portions of the Bill allows discrimination against people from trangenders community. Last week, the law makers of New Carolina had reached the compromise to repeal many provisions of the law, known as House Bill 2.The deal prohibits local communities from passing any anti-discrimination ordinances for at least three years. According to the sanitation ministry's circular, many from the third-gender group have emerged as the champions of government's Swachhta drive. \u201cWherever suitable, their support can be enlisted in engaging communities, and their efforts duly recognised and honoured to break any stigma around them and also to enable them to use facilities without any embarrassment,\u201c the circular said. This is not the first time when the government has talked of \u201cinclusivity\u201c to ensure that people from all genders are respected so far as availing public services and facilities are concerned. The urban development ministry had enacted the Real Estate Regulation law, which has \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201c clause to allow anyone to buy a property in a complex including by a third-gender. Meanwhile, the rural sanitation ministry has asked states to ensure that at least 50% of the members in Village Water and Sanitation Committees are women. Read this story in Bengali"

Neither has been any survey conducted to ascertain the level of awareness about HIV/AIDS, its prevention and safe sex among youngsters. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) in its latest guidelines stresses on surveys after every two years. With the focus of the AIDS control programme on increasing awareness among the youths, the health authorities have failed to figure if there has been any improvement in the awareness level among city youths. Dr Uggar Singh Sooch, district programme officer of HIV/AIDS, said they had last conducted a HIV sentinel surveillance survey in 2008 in Ludhiana, but no survey was conducted after that. All that the health authorities have done during this period is to maintain a regular record of new cases. Sooch said the new NACP guidelines are a part of NACP-IV, which is yet to start. \"I acknowledge that a comprehensive survey would have helped in planning the move ahead based on the statistics, but there have been certain factors that hinder the process. Unlike cancer, where people come forward for survey, there is a stigma attached to HIV/AIDS that keeps many from participating in a survey,\" he added. Sooch said they haven't devised any survey that lets them ascertain if the awareness among people about AIDS has improved, but as a casual observation, he adds, \"It may have increased over the years\". Dr Jasbir Dhanoa, former head, department of medicine at Christian Medical College and Hospital who has worked on HIV/AIDS in the city, said, \"Fighting HIV/AIDS is one of the most important concerns of the country. A survey should be done every two years, but it is up to the government to implement the suggestions.\" Social activist Ajaydeep Singh who has been involved with various causes, said a survey to figure out the trends and awareness level regarding the disease should be conducted immediately if it hasn't been conducted over last five years. Proper statistics would help the authorities devise a proper plan to tackle the spread of the disease,\" added Singh."

Earlier, the child and her parents were living in a makeshift tent under National Highway flyover in Surathkal in the city. Tragedy struck Sunaina when she lost her HIV positive mother a month ago. Later, it was another sequential shocker for her when she lost her father too. Fortunately for her, Thabassum, founder, Sneha Deep, gave Sunaina a helping hand by offering her food, clothing and shelter, and most of all, education. When Thabassum came to know about Sunaina's plight through locals , she brought Sunaina to Sneha Deep and now the girl has been admitted to class 1 in a local school. Sneha Deep, which was started by Thabassum in 2010 in the city, has 15 children of HIV parents. Thabassum takes care of children with the same love and care that any other mothers deliver. Sunaina, whose test reports show negative for HIV is happy to be with Sneha Deep. A social worker, Thabassum runs the centre with the support of donors and fights literally to manage daily and monthly expenses. Braving all odds in the city, especially the negative reactions from the community and society, Thabassum continues to care for children in her centre. Narrating the story of Sunaina, Thabassum told TOI that the girl will be given good care and education. \"I was born and brought up in a poor family. I fought all odds to complete my education. The death of a friend, who was suffering from HIV, touched my heart and that made me dedicate my life to children of HIV positive parents. It requires at least Rs 55,000 per month to run the centre. I am now taking care of children. I do not consider caste, religion or any other aspects before accepting a responsibility for a child,\" said Thabassum, who strives to bring smiles to deprived children. Rasheed Vitla, a well-wisher of Sneha Deep, said, \"Sunaina is a happy girl now that she has a happy home in Sneha Deep and a loving mother in Thabassum.\""

Earlier, the HIV testing facilities were available at all government medical colleges, district hospitals and community heath centres of seven high risk districts. Now, RSACS has decided not to keep confine the HIV testing facilities at high risk districts but also to expand it to other districts as well. \"Rajasthan has a special situation in terms of equal HIV prevalence rates of both urban and rural areas,\" an RSACS official said. The official said already 182 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) are in the state. However, majority of the ICTCs were located at seven districts - Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Barmar and Sriganganagar. Except in these seven districts, the other districts lack testing centres. The HIV testing in private hospitals is costly but at the government's centres, it is free of cost, the official said, adding that expanding the testing facility would strengthen healthcare facilities in the state. Apart from 182, another 282 more testing centres would be opened in the state with help from the staff of the community health centres (CHC). The RSACS would provide HIV testing kits to the CHCs. Trained counselors would be posted at the CHCs and would counsel people coming to the centre for HIV testing. For the purpose, the RSACS would provide training to National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) employees deployed at the CHCs. The RSACS data show that till January of the financial year 2010-11, altogether 1.92 lakh general clients were counseled, 1.87 lakh tested and 6,417 persons tested positive for the HIV. The new ICTC would impart information people about HIV prevention, counsels them to undergo testing, provides testing facilities and also links positive people with treatment, care and support system, the RSACS said. The society further said HIV testing facilities help in identifying new HIV positive cases and provide the new cases a quality of life by linking them with support and care."

Earlier last month, the World Health Organization declared that since 2007, the number of new infections has remained the same, indicating a fall in the number of new incidences of the virus. The Nagpur District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) confirms the prevalence of the trend in the city as well. Of the total general population tested for the presence of the virus in 2002, 33.55% tested positive while in 2011 the figure dropped to 3.31%. Similarly, among the pregnant women who were tested, 1.10% were found positive in 2002 as against only 0.29% in 2011. Surveys conducted by National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) showed a drastic surge in the number of citizens who approached to test themselves for HIV. In a statistical study, 5,047 people tested positive for HIV in 2002 with 20% testing rate. In 2010, patients as high as 1,17,915 approached these centres with a testing rate of 2.99% indicating a drastic fall in the number of infected patients, according to the recent survey. \"The government has the facility for providing free ART (anti-retroviral therapy), counselling, medical treatment, white blood cells count and tuberculosis cure among other things. NACO carries out routine checkup and awareness programmes to exterminate ignorance about the disease from the society,\" said Ganesh Parihar, programme officer of DAPCU. He added that many 24/7 testing and helpline centres have been started under the banner of ICTC (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres). \"21 standalone centres and 29 ICTCs are 24/7 helpline centres working in the city,\" he said. District manager of Avert society Nitin Bhowate said, \"Awareness about STDs and sexual health has increased manifold in the general populace, thanks to a rise in NGOs that have worked to help AIDS-affected people. Mobile vans of ICTC centres have enabled us to help the hard-to-reach population which is why the general awareness has increased.\" Another project that is being run by NACO Children Affected By AIDS (CABA) that looks after the children infected by AIDS and the unborn who may be genetically predisposed to the virus. Madhuri Giri, project coordinator of CABA, told TOI, \"We have received 180 registrations for treatment of AIDS so far and have already started treating 58 children,\" informed Giri. Though private practitioners also treat people living with HIV (PLHIV), the cost of treatment goes up manifold in a private set up. \"It is a common view that government hospitals are not sanitized and the procedure of registration is cumbersome. To provide a solution to this, we personally request and fix an appointment with tehsildars. We act as a catalyst in receiving consent from patients and to carry out treatment as early as possible\" said Babita Soni, president of Sanjeevan Bahudeshi Samaj Seva Sanstha that promotes access to care and treatment for AIDS affected people. Despite the optimism shown by most volunteers and activists, some believe that the cloud does have a silver lining. \"There are many hidden cases among the general population that are not coming out on their own. Many of them may not even be aware of themselves being carriers of the virus. I don't see much happening in that direction. The figures only speak the story of those willing to be tested, not the others. With their inclusion, the picture may not be as rosy as it looks,\" said Anand Changrani, project director of Saarthi Trust, an NGO working for the LGBTQ community in the city."

That deal also transformed Mylan, which till then operated only in the US, into one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). On a recent visit to Bengaluru, Malik spoke to TOI:We know India has become a key part of your operations. Can you give us some quantitative measures of that?Out of a global workforce of 35,000 employees, more than 15,000 are based out of this country \u2014 1,800 of them are involved in R&D. We have the corporate team for emerging markets in India that determines which are the new countries we want to expand to, what are the strategies we need to adopt and so on. Today, Mylan\u2019s manufacturing platform includes more than 40 facilities, 25 of which are located in India. Those include all nine of our API facilities, eight of our OSD (oral solid doses) facilities, and eight of our injectable facilities, which manufacture our high quality medicines for markets all over the world, including emerging markets.You said you have a large R&D team here. Has this team delivered good innovations?Absolutely. Our commercial businesses based in India market high quality APIs to third parties around the world and anti-retroviral (ARV) products for people living with HIV/AIDS. Today, nearly 50% of those receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world rely on a Mylan product, all of which are made by us in India. In fact, Mylan is India\u2019s third largest pharmaceutical exporter. Some think developing generic drugs involves zero or little R&D. But that\u2019s far from the truth.We were second to enter the US in the marketing of a generic version of AstraZeneca\u2019s heartburn drug Nexium, but we still managed to build a market share of 35-40% (the first mover typically has a huge advantage). That product was made from our facility in Nashik in Maharashtra. We were once the top API supplier to Cipla for HIV drugs but now we have more products than them. Due to our end-toend play, we have been able to bring the costs of such drugs down to $100 from $10,000.How do you see the patent environment in India?I think India has done a good job in balancing the idea of affordability and protection of science. India respects the basic molecule and it\u2019s a fair play as you need generics to reach millions of people.What are the major new drugs in the pipeline?A lot of work is going on in the field of oncology, diabetes and Hepatitis C. We were one of the licensing partners of Gilead from India to market its blockbuster drug Sovaldi for Hepatitis C in 94 countries. That pushed down the price of the drug to $900 from $84,000. People from Australia, New Zealand and Europe are coming to India to buy the drug due to its affordability."

In 2008, the prevalence of the virus among antenatal attendees was recorded at 0.13 per cent. Addressing a meeting on the eve of World AIDS Day on Saturday, state epidemiologist of ASACS Chiranjeev Bhattacharjee said, \"In Assam, a rising trend in HIV prevalence, especially among pregnant women, has been observed but it is still lower when compared to other groups. The evidence suggests that the HIV epidemic in the state is mainly driven by bridge populations such as migrants and the truckers.\" He said the absence of sentinel sites to monitor HIV prevalence among truckers and migrants is responsible for the limited data on their role in the spread of HIV from high risk groups to the general populace. Assam has about 8,580 HIV positive cases, out of which around 5,229 are male, 2948 are female, seven are transgender and 396 are children."

In addition, the scientists from California Institute of Technology demonstrated that a particular antibody to gp120 makes contact not only with the protein, but with CD4 receptor that gp120 uses to gain entrance into the body's T cells. This three-dimensional understanding of how gp120 is built is more than just a basic scientific advance, they say. \"There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120. Having more structural information will facilitate better vaccine design,\" said lead scientist Ron Diskin. The team looked specifically at gp120 from what is known as clade C HIV-1. To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades. Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is \"the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,\" said Diskin. \"It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide.\" In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true \u2014 the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c."

The programme was organised to mark the World AIDS Day (December 1) and raise awareness about the disease. About 500 children, both girls and boys of different age groups are given treatment at the ART centre, deputy programme director (HIV/AIDS) at BHU ART centre, Dr Jaya Chakravarty said. The programme was organised to encourage the children to fight against the disease. Over 15,000 adults (both men and women) are registered with this centre, out of whom 6,000 make regular visit to take medicines. She said that BHU ART centre is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and lone in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Besides being the tertiary centre to provide second and third line drugs, the BHU ART is also a research and training centre. The ART centre was started in March 2005 in BHU and it was upgraded to a centre of excellence (COE) in August, 2009. According to the doctor, if by mistake one acquires this disease, he/she should not lose courage and should get investigated and proper medication. The early diagnosis helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV people can live a productive and healthy life if they take care of health, eating habits and lifestyle. In last one year, over 100 new HIV patients were identified in several high risk areas of the city, said the president of Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV-AIDS."

As soon as he died, Mitali's in-laws tried to throw her and little Sanju out of the house, calling her a witch and a husband killer. However, Mitali's mother, who lives nearby, fought back fiercely and forced them to keep the mother-child. Sanju's father started complaining of a debilitating weakness and had constant attacks of cold and cough and stomach ailments in March this year. Gradually he became so weak that he couldn't go to work any longer and spent the day lying in bed. He was initially treated at Kharagpur subdivisional hospital, which sent him to Midnapore Medical College, where he was detected with full blown AIDS. Once they knew he had AIDS, the hospital refused to keep him. Mitali brought him back and he died on June 5. The local doctor then advised her and her two children to go for an HIV screening. Mitali and Sanju tested positive but her elder son, a six-year-old, was clean. Neither the family nor the locality knew the difference between HIV and AIDS and treated Mitali and Sanju like taboo. Mother-in-law Bakulrani was adamant that they would not live under the same roof. She called her daughter and son-in-law from Kolkata and gathered her other sons around her to throw out the mother and child. They tried to force Mitali's mother, Shampa Deb to take her back, but she refused. \"I live with my brother's family. I don't have space to take them back. Why should they be turned out of their own house? They don't have AIDS and even if they did, it is not infectious. What crime have they committed?\" asked Shampa, who often has to send food for Mitali and Sanju lest they go hungry. Shampa first approached local councillor Jaya Pal for help. Pal visited the family and persuaded Bakulrani against turning Mitali out. Kharagpur municipality chairman Jawahar Pal, the councillor's father-in-law, also came to the rescue. \"We found that not only her family but the entire Chatimtala area had turned against the poor woman and her son. The locals feared that her disease was contagious. They complained to me that if mosquitoes bit them and then bit others, the disease would spread. I have tried my best to alleviate such unscientific fears ,\" said Jawahar. The local Chatimtala Club also came around eventually. \"We were a little hesitant at first because we thought that the mother-child could infect others. But we have understood now and will ensure that theyMitali and her son are not turned out,\" said Kartick Kanungo, a club member. But not everyone in the locality is as aware. As Sanju toddled up to a grocery store to buy some lozenges, the shopkeeper shooed him away. \"Stand outside the shop, keep the money there and leave,\" the shopkeeper said, throwing the candies at the boy. \"I think she is a polluted woman who gave her husband and son the disease. She should suffer,\" said a neighbour. The district's chief medical officer (health), Sabitendra Patra, promised regular monitoring of Mitali and her son from Saturday. A medical team will be sent to spread awareness in the neighbourhood. \"We first need to contain the panic in the area. We will educate people so that the mother and son are treated with compassion. We will also take care of their treatment. Since they are HIV-positive, they will have to be under medication throughout their lives,\" said West Midnapore district magistrate Surendra Gupta. The district has 306 HIV-positive patients."

        "title": "In 16 months, 127 patients contracted HIV due to inappropriate blood transfusion",
        "body": "BENGALURU: Karnataka ranks sixth in India in terms of transmission of HIV through blood transfusion. According to a study by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), between January 2015 and May 2016, 127 patients in the state contracted HIV due to inappropriate blood transfusion. Out of 184 licensed blood banks in the state, only 66 are NACO certified for safe blood. Going by the report, Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 371 HIV positive cases triggered through blood transfusion, followed by Gujarat (292), Maharashtra (276), New Delhi (264) and West Bengal (135). Officials at Indian Foundation for Safe Blood (IFSB), an organization that works towards creating awareness about diseases transmitted during blood transfusions, said: \u201cGlobally, 15 % of HIV is transmitted through blood transfusions and in India the rate is extremely alarming. In the past five years, 9,000 people in India got affected by HIV due to blood transfusion. In Chhattisgarh blood transfusion has become a major carrier of AIDS. In Jodhpur, 53 kids were tested positive for Hepatitis C after receiving infected blood. Although better than five other states, Karnataka still doesn\u2019t look safe.\u201d Blood transfused without proper checks could result in deadly infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis, Dengue and Chikungunya. Explaining the reasons behind random collection of blood, IFSB officials added: \u201cOften, shortage of blood leads to unhealthy ways of collecting it. Another problem is non-availability of the exact blood group. Also, only a very small percentage of blood is collected through repeat voluntary blood donors, who are the safest donors. Most of the others are first-time donors who are more likely to transmit infections as they aren\u2019t tested in advance. Further, majority of blood is collected through mass blood donation camps which lack proper facilities for screening.\u201d Asked about ways to tackle the problem, another source from IFSB said, \u201cThe method of testing needs to improve. The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) method should be used to detect HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. NAT is conducted in two ways --- Mini Pool Nucleic Acid Testing and Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID NAT). In the first one, blood samples are pooled together for the purpose of testing. However, there\u2019s a disadvantage. Even if one sample contains a virus, the entire batch has to be discarded and each sample tested individually all over again. ID NAT is the best method as it captures the virus itself. Increase in voluntary repeat blood donation, pre-donation health history screening and hemovigilance programme are other ways to address the issue.\u201d ID NAT method ID NAT is a conventional method of testing blood. It requires the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. ID NAT is used to detect the low levels of viral genetic material present in the body. However, it happens before the body begins producing antibodies in response to a virus, enabling detection of a disease early. This method significantly reduces the time between donor exposure to the virus and the appearance of antibodies. This way, it allows for earlier detection of the infection and thereby reduces the possibility of transmission via transfusion. Pvt hospitals to blame According to NACO data, of the 66 NACO-assisted blood banks in Karnataka, 40 are in the government sector and 26 are in NGOs, charitable and voluntary sector, without a single one in the private hospital sector. IFBS officials say Karnataka has already taken steps to curb transmission of infection through blood transfusion and that it\u2019s the only state government in the country to have made ID NAT mandatory in all government blood banks and hospitals. However, this crucial blood safety technique hasn\u2019t been widely adopted by private hospitals in the state. Other affected states . Uttar Pradesh - 361 \u00b7 Gujarat - 292 \u00b7 Maharashtra - 276 \u00b7 New Delhi - 264 \u00b7 West Bengal - 135 Licensed blood banks in Karnataka \u00b7 Government hospitals - 40 \u00b7 Private hospital - 92 \u00b7 Indian Red Cross Society - 5 \u00b7 Voluntary and charitable blood banks - 36 \u00b7 Standalone private blood banks -- 11 .

That's what 21-year-old Sumanth (name changed) did. Sumanth, a HIV +ve, is a flower vendor, part-time autorickshaw driver and an activist now. But all this did not come easily. \"The past eight years of my life have been full of hardships and humiliation. But I was not ready to give up,'' said Sumanth, a class 10 dropout from Kanakapura village. \"My parents died about eight years back. We were told that my father, a bus driver, had some infection. In 2008, I used to get fever frequently. A doctor treated me for two-three months and later referred me to Indira Gandhi Hospital. I was diagnosed with HIV,\" he told TOI. Recounting the humiliation that followed, a lean but well-dressed Sumanth said: \"I could not go to school for about a month. My grandmother was summoned to school and when asked she told my teacher that I had some illness called 'AIDS' . My school never allowed me after that. My grandmother had no idea that speaking the truth would close the door of education for me.\" Sumanth, who was living with his maternal uncle, was thrown out of the house. Even his elder brother (who was lucky enough to not get the virus from his parents) cut ties with him. \"I went to my friend's house. His parents were kind enough to allow me to stay there for three-four days. But I decided to leave my village and come to Bangalore ,\" he said. He took a train from Kanakapura and came to Bangalore in 2009. The railway platforms were his home for about a week. He saw a poster of one NGO which helped HIV +ve people. And that was the defining moment in his life. \"I went to the NGO's office, they referred me to another NGO, which gave me a job of a driver and other office work. I was feeling better as I was financially independent. The ART (antiretroviral) treatment was working and my health had improved. I worked with the NGO for about a year and then went back to my grandmother,\" said Sumanth. Sumanth has now taken up a small-time business of selling flowers. He also works as a volunteer with NGOs, counselling young persons with HIV. \"I sell flowers from 6am to 11am, rest for a while and then drive the autorikshaw. My net income, after deducting all expenses including medication, is about Rs 3,000-4000 a month. My brother is now good to me. I am grateful to my friends and the NGOs who helped me,\" he said. Some gyaan HIV can only be transmitted through body fluids like blood, semen or breast milk and not through touch It's usually diagnosed through blood tests Effective treatment with antiretroviral drugs can control the virus and people with HIV can enjoy healthy and productive lives."

To push sex workers and the general public towards safe sex, the government supplied condoms in attractive packs to compete with other condom manufacturing companies. Now, these freely available condoms have prevented many sex workers and their customers from falling prey to HIV. The Society for People\u2019s Action for Development (SPAD), an NGO working for the betterment of sex workers and educating them on avoiding AIDS, distributes 16,000 condoms per month. During the festive season, the number increases to 18,000 per month. According to sources, earlier, due to customers\u2019 reluctance, sex workers would not use government condoms, but now they are in demand. Veerappa Tegur, programme manager, SPAD, said 19 peer educators among sex workers are working to educate the fraternity on safe sex. Nine peer educators in Hubballi and 10 in Dharwad are working in the campaign. \u201cIn Hubballi-Dharwad, Alnavar and Kundgol, there are 1,489 sex workers, of which nearly half operate from their homes and the rest in the lodges, market area and the bus terminus. Peer educators provide condoms without fail to sex workers,\u201d he said. There is an adequate supply of condoms, and condoms are supplied every three months based on the requirement. In a day, a sex worker uses five to six condoms, Tegur added. Shaila Doddamani, peer educator, SPAD, said initially sex workers were reluctant, but now they use condoms without any hesitation. Sex workers from the city and rural areas of Hubballi, Dharwad, Davanagere, Haveri, Shiggaon, and Vijayapura are engaged in sex work in Hubballi. \u201cWe meet each sex worker personally and convince her to use condoms to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. We provide condoms as per their need and every three months, we take them for clinical check-ups and every six months for speculum test and HIV test,\u201d he said."

The department is working in cooperation with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) to open a facility for the people deprived of second line treatment here. AIDS director PK Sharda said, \"Second line treatment is very expensive. So, with the help of NACO we will set up centres for it in Jaipur and Jodhpur, the process for which has already started.\" The doctors claimed due to poor adherence to the treatment regimen, resistance to first line treatment happens. It is very necessary to put such people on second line immediately to save their life. An NGO working in the state, Rajasthan Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS' president Brijesh Dubey said, \"At present such people have to travel to Ahmedabad or Delhi, which is very tiring as they are already weak. So, there is a desperate requirement for second line ART.\" So far 39 AIDS patients from SMS hospital's ART centre have been referred to Delhi's second line ART centre. At present, 10 out of them are still on second line ART drugs. Assistant to nodal officer ART, SMS hospital, Dr Harsh Vardhan, said, \"The survival rate at second line ART is more than 65%. It is very necessary to put a person resistant to first line drugs on second line to save his life. The medicines used are very expensive, they, too, will be provided free of cost at the centre.\" Sources said the groundwork for opening the second line centre at SMS hospital has been completed as doctors have been trained and some medicines have also arrived.

        "body": "VARANASI: It is perhaps the most disturbing moment for a person when he comes to know that he is HIV positive. And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population. \"In Varanasi district alone, there are over 1,000 persons infected with HIV and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP,\" informed secretary, Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (commonly known as BNP+), Sunil Seth. The network is spread over 30 districts of the state with active members to motivate and help HIV persons to lead a purposeful life. However, according to WHO report, over 34 million people are living with HIV and AIDS across the world. India alone, with 2.3 million cases of HIV, has the third highest number of HIV affected persons in the world. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), around 3,22,521 persons were taking treatment for AIDS by April 2010. And, to give a new lease of life to such persons, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. \"So far, 11,321 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU,\" said Dr Jaya of the centre. \"Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines,\" she added. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and the only in Uttar Pradesh, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It monitors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. It is also a training and research centre. According to the doctor, those patients registered in ART centre of BHU, who have completed six month's therapy and are stable and have increasing CD4 count, can be referred to Link ART centres affiliated to BHU ART centre established in the neighbouring districts of Ballia, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau, Sonebhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Azamgarh. They are basically drug distribution centres. Beside the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centre, Shiv Prasad Gupta District Hospital Kabirchoura, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Regional Hospital Pandeypur and Central Jail Hospital Sivpur are other centres where free HIV investigation is available under NACO supervision. The crux of the whole exercise is to protect precious human life. The doctor says if by mistake one deviates and acquires this disease, he should not lose courage. He should get investigated and should take proper medicine and advice from the health personnel. An early diagnosis of HIV status helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, or he starts and stops the drugs abruptly, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV infected person can live a productive and healthy life if he takes care of his health, eating habits and lifestyle. Vital Facts What is HIV? Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus, which damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections. How it spreads HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, hand shaking, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, it is migrant population, truck drivers, community sex workers and IV drug abusers who are affected. They, in turn, spread the disease to their wives, children and clients. Clinical presentation Within a few weeks of being infected, some people get fever, headache, sore muscles and joints, stomach ache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash for one or two weeks. Most people think it is flu. After the initial illness, patients can remain symptom free for many years (3-10 years), as the CD4 cell count decreases and the immunity decreases the patient first gets minor infection then the severity of infection increases. The last stage of HIV infection is when the CD4 decreases below 200 per micro litre is called AIDS when the patient may succumb to minor illness. How to get tested If any person wants to get himself tested for HIV, he should go to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) which provides free testing and counselling. The ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. If a person tests positive, he is referred to the nearest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre. Treatment Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available that can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be started on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment, if started, has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment so as to prevent failure of the drug regimen. Where to go for treatment The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) hospital of BHU provides free HIV testing, treatment, counselling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.

        "body": "CHENNAI: Has Tamil Nadu been successful in its battle against HIV/AIDS? Yes and no. The state recorded a marked decline in incidence of HIV infection and deaths from AIDS between 2009 and 2013 among both men and women. However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period. READ ALSO: AIDS can be brought under control by 2030 \u2014 UNAIDS Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%. Tamil Nadu \u2014 one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra \u2014 recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013. If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%. Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported. \"Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,\" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO Indian Community Welfare Organisation, which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period. The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream? Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function. \"It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,\" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board. Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. \"The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,\" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI). But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender \u2014 stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned \u2014 have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others. Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. \"I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,\" she says. \"Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed.\" Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. \"Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,\" she says. \"I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,\" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders. Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. \"They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,\" he says. \"Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option.\" Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. \"That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,\" he says. But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. \"Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,\" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. \"We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants.\" \"I did not wish to be transgender,\" she says. \"I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,\" she says. Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. \"We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,\" she says. \"Not a day goes by without a transgender being beaten up by customers or drunkards.\""

It is alleged that she was advised to get herself tested and treated, if required, for post-exposure prophylaxes. The nature of infection being life-threatening, several repeated tests at various intervals had to be done as a matter of procedure till final confirmation by way of a report on HIV detection. The complainant subjected herself to various tests from different laboratories to ascertain whether the HIV virus had passed into her at the time of the incident,\" said the order. The tests revealed there was no infection, but the doctor went for a final test to Dr Lal PathLabs in Delhi \u201cbecause it possessed state-of-the-art equipment for various tests and was known for its expertise,\" read the order. On August 4, 2003, the complainant received a call from the Pune office of that laboratory which conveyed to her that the report was positive. This traumatized her and her family members and plunged them into gloom and fear. Next day, a second confirmation test was carried out. The doctor alleged that as a result of the initial report and confusion created by it, she got admitted and subjected herself to a series of tests and Army procedures. A court of inquiry way set up on August 6, 2003, and, consequently, the complainant was placed in a low medical category for prospective HIV infection on September 16, 2003. \u201cThis allegedly caused grave mental agony, loss of reputation and respect, and stigma and (she) had to undergo a rigorous process of observation and restriction for 12 weeks,\u201d said the court order. The lab argued that test conducted on the complainant was not a diagnostic test."

On the contrary, the mothers have been assured that the gates of Khanakul Rural Hospital, 120 km from Kolkata - where the feat was pulled off on Monday-Tuesday - will remain open to them for treatment and counselling. Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section. They had an anaesthetist and nurses Amita Batabyal and Swati Pal helping them. Both women, aged about 25, are healthy and the newborns - a boy and a girl - are doing fine. Their HIV status, however, is still not clear. The team is proud of its achievement but believes they have just done their duty. \"We were just keen to help these poor women deliver safely. Without our support they would have been helpless, probably even ostracized by the community and left to die without treatment. Ever since they sought our help nine months ago, we were determined to shield them from all adversities and make sure they delivered safely. It was not easy but we managed to do our job,\" said Prosenjit Pal. The women, who probably contracted the deadly virus from their husbands, visited the ramshackle hospital for a pregnancy test earlier this year. To their horror, doctors found that both had HIV. They were immediately taken to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and briefed. \"There were a hundred odds. Touts at the hospital, neighbours and the stigma of an incurable disease with its sexual connotation. But we were determined not to let these affect the women. We took it on as a challenge and kept monitoring them regularly till they got admitted for their delivery,\" said Susanta Pal. Regular checks, counselling and advice through their pregnancy helped the women gain confidence. The doctors and the hospital counsellor Abhijit Maity even counselled their families, convincing them that the disease, though incurable, was not as contagious as it is made out to be. And that they needed their support. It worked. The families stood by the women and made sure no one got to know about their illness. Prosenjit Pal then got about preparing his team for the delivery. Some hospital staff initially refused to cooperate but block medical officer Sabyasachi Saha moved in and made it clear that no one would be allowed to shirk responsibility. \"I told each staff member that they would be thrown out if they refused to work for the patients. There was no murmur after that,\" said Saha. As the delivery date approached, doctors tried to gather all the meagre resources that they had at their disposal. The OT was disinfected and the floors cleaned painstakingly. \"We knew it was not enough and that the babies were still at risk. But we left no stone unturned,\" said Susanta Pal. Last week, it was detected that one of the women had a complication that would necessitate a C-section. So, we had to be on our toes and called for a last-minute meeting to make sure things were in order. We were tense and excited at the same time,\" said Prosenjit Pal. The team camped at the hospital on Sunday night and readied for the first delivery on Monday - the normal one. It went off smoothly with the woman delivering a healthy boy. The next day was the real test. \"Our OT does not have the basic facilities for a Caesarean, which is why such surgeries are not done here. In this case, we couldn't refer her to another hospital, for she would certainly have been refused. Also, neither woman could afford the cost of a sustained treatment,\" said Saha. The surgery was a success with the woman giving birth to a girl. The umbilical cord had got entangled around the baby's neck, but it was successfully negotiated by Pal. \"It was a huge relief for all of us. For nine months, we had been waiting for this day,\" he said. \"The biggest satisfaction is that we have broken the myth and set aside all the obstacles, practically doing the surgery out of nothing,\" said Susanta Pal. Lab technician Saradindu Manna was moved to see the tears in the women's eyes after delivery. \"It reminded us that HIV-infected people have a right to live,\" he said. For 72 hours, the entire team, including the doctors and counsellor Maity stayed put at the hospital, making sure nothing went wrong. No special precautions were taken by doctors other than gloves, an extra gown and glasses. The mothers and their babies were given Neviropine to try and make sure the newborns didn't contract the virus. \"It's still too early to know that. We are keeping our fingers crossed,\" said Prosenjit Pal."

        "body": "NAGPUR: A scam in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria uncovered in January 2011 has been affecting India's fight against Human Immunovirus (HIV). Over the past couple of years, drying up of funding from the international agency has resulted in shutting down of several facilities. For the past few days, antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres across the country have been suffering from a shortage of medicines. An increasing number of patients being served by the ART centres is only making matters worse. Doctors in the centres from the city have been redirecting the patients to buy medicines that otherwise would have been provided free of cost to them. The city has three such centres, while a fourth one is being planned to overcome the patients' difficulties. Replying to a complaint about shortage of medicines at the centres, national programme officer of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) Dr BB Rewari wrote, \"We did have some shortage of drugs due to late supplies, but all drugs have now been received at all State AIDS Control Societies. In case there is still a shortage at any sites due to distribution issues, as our partner, PLHA network is requested to inform concerned SACS immediately.\" Similar shortages are being seen in other ART centres across the country, too. Sources said that the entire supply chain has been affected by the global fund scam. \"World Health Organisation (WHO) had also prescribed a drug different from the one being given at the ART centers around the same time. The stocks of these new medicines were less than the required amount whereas the stocks of the older medicines are still being used whenever there is a deficit of the new one,\" said a source. However, some of the patients did not want the older medicines and so had to be asked to buy the new ones off the market. One ART centre should ideally be providing services to less than 2,000 patients, informed Tanuja Fale, programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). \"In 2005, there was only one ART centre in the city, now there are three, one each at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Mayo Hospital and Kamthi that as started earlier this year. The centres at both the hospitals get more than 2,500 patients every day,\" she said. To counter this difficulty, DAPCU is trying to open one more ART centre in the city, she said. There are many complaints that patients have with the existing centres, though. \"The centre at GMCH is on the first floor and so a bit difficult to access for patients. There is no proper seating arrangement there too,\" said Sunil Mhaiskar of NGO Sanjeevan Bahudeshi Samaj Seva Sanstha. His organization has approached the Supreme Court for shifting the centre and the issue will be raised in the upcoming Winter Assembly, too. Another activist, Anand Chandrani of Saarthi Trust said that because of the overload, the counselors at the centres are not being able to do much. \"According to NACO guidelines, every patient needs to have a 40-minute session with the counselor. With only a couple of counselors looking after more than 200 patients a day, not much time can be given to every individual,\" he said. The centres are even short of sufficient staff to handle the rush of patients, he added. THE CURRENT PROBLEM: For the past two months, HIV patients are only given maximum five days supply of medicine Short supply of medicine at ART centres forces them to buy drugs off the market RECURRENT PROBLEMS: At GMCH, the ART centre being on the first floor causes accessibility problem to many patients. The centre there is also congested and has no proper seating arrangement Medicine out of stock several times, especially those meant for children are perpetually unavailable The only CD4 machine in the city was defunct for some time earlier and it took months to get operational No viral load machine in any ART centre in city Overload of patients does not give enough time for proper counseling PATIENTS PROBLEMS: Machines do not work most of the times Second line treatment is available at GMCH, still most patients requiring it need to go to Mumbai or Pune Counselors, sometimes, ask personal questions and say moral depreciating things SOLUTION: Opening more ART centers in the city Another CD4 machine and viral load for the city being planned"

Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial court\u2019s verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a \"travesty of justice\" to convict him of having committed such an \u201cunsolved\u201d crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner. Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge \u201cignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted.\u201d In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. \u201cThe situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved \u2018locked room mystery\u2019, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court). This is entirely impermissible in law,\u201d HC noted. While the child's father was in jail, his mother had died of HIV and, as there was not nobody to look after him, he was sent to the children home for boys."

A new study in Gastroenterology, which is the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association, said that people with AIDS were at an increased risk for developing oesophageal and stomach carcinoma as well as non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The Human Immuno-deficient Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, cripples the body\u2019s immune system and makes the person susceptible to various ailments ranging from skin rashes to tuberculosis as well as cancers. The study\u2019s authors have been quoted as saying, \"People diagnosed with AIDS are living longer due to improved therapies. However, they remain at increased risk of developing a number of different cancers.\" Researchers of the National Cancer Institute found an elevated risk of oesophageal and stomach cancers had been observed before, but they were able to look at risk for subtypes of these malignancies. The researchers analysed data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, which links data collected from 1980 to 2007 for 16 US population-based HIV and AIDS and cancer registries. They compared risks of stomach and oesophageal cancers in 596,955 people with AIDS with those of the general population."

Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, project director, Bihar State AIDS Control Society, assured the agitators to look into the matter and solve their problem within 24 hours. The police were called to the office premises in view of the agitation. The agitators claimed that life-saving AIDS drugs and CD4 test kits were not reaching people living with HIV. According to the local PLHIV sources, several medicines were out of stock. Gyan Ranjan, president, PLHIV Bihar, said, \"There are 56,000 people living with HIV in Bihar while the entire state has only 14 ART centres, including two in Patna. Many of the centres do not have sufficient number of doctors.\" Every ART centre should have two doctors to counsel 500-1,000 HIV+ people. \"But the fact is there is no doctor at the Katihar ART centre for the last four months. People have to visit the Bhagalpur centre from districts like Katihar, Araria and Purnia,\" Gyan Ranjan said. \"At Bettiah, Khagaria and a few other centres, which take care of over 1,000 patients, there are only two doctors while there is an urgent need of four doctors. The PMCH ART centre itself is handled by a single doctor,\" he said. He said members of the PLHIV from different districts of the state came to Patna on Wednesday to demand sufficient medicines and doctors. \"The medicines are life-saving drugs for the HIV+ patients. Even one-hour delay in taking the medicine can be fatal for the victim,\" he said. According to the PLHIV members, problems often arise due to poor planning, incorrect projections of local requirements, poor distribution and supply of medicine and CD4 test kits and expiry of medicines."

The merger of the DAC with the NRHM programme is a shocking development for people like us especially when NACP-IV is progressing towards achieving its programmatic goals in prevention and treatment.\" Those working in the sector for prevention said the activities carried out by National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) will also be merged with NRHM and that it will lose its special status to run target-based programmes."

In fact, the hostel committee had left it up to the students to produce a medical certificate to prove their fitness.Postgraduate student Vikesh Timande was the first to red flag the controversial norm.Timande is an applicant for hostel accommodation and had noticed that the disease was mentioned under different types of prohibitions. \u201cI was going through the terms and conditions for hostel accommodation. I realized that the diseases mentioned in the list breached constitutional rights of an individual,\u201d he said.Without wasting time, Timande initiated an online campaign and also researched on the issue. \u201cI came to know that some students were discriminated on the basis of they being HIV+.

Following opposition by parents of around 17 students at Amboli village government primary school, the orphaned HIV+ girls could not attend school for almost a month. The district administration has, however, adopted a tough stance and deployed police bandobast at the school premises from Saturday. The girls started going to school last week but due to random demonstration by the parents opposing their presence, they were not attending regularly. From Monday, the girls will attend school in the presence of 10 men and women police personnel outside the school. To give a clear message to the protesting parents, a team of district, panchayat and police officials visited the village on Saturday and decided to take help of police. \"We are going to continue the police bandobast till the villagers continue their protest. Many students wish to study in the school and we are making sure that they are not deprived,\" said J A Patel, deputy superintendent of police, Surat. Earlier, district collectorate and health department conveyed to villagers that their protest was out of place and nothing can stop the girls from studying. Several rounds of meetings were held with villagers, majority of whom were convinced. Out of 210 students, parents of only 17 are continuing their protest. \"We have been ordered to make sure that the school should operate. All those who want to study can now go to school and the HIV+ girls will also study in the same school. On Saturday, a group of parents gathered near the school. We warned them of legal action and made sure that the school operates without disturbance,\" said Patel. \"We hope that the villagers show little sympathy for the girls as they are already living a troubled life,\" said an official of Gujarat State Network of Positive People (GSNP+). Sanjay Patel, deputy sarpanch of Amboli, said that villagers want to continue their protest in a Gandhian way. \"They are unwilling to send their children to study with the HIV+ girls,\" he added. In all, 36 orphan HIV+ girls are being taken care by GSNP+. The girls were earlier living in Puna Gam area of the city in two apartments. However, discrimination by locals and space limitation forced them to shift to a donated accommodation near Amboli, around 10 km away from Surat in April."

        "body": "SURAT: The Diamond City that had acquired the dubious distinction of being the AIDS capital of Gujarat has now started showing signs of improvement. Number of new HIV infections have shown a decline of 15-20% in the last five years. The reason, believe experts, is primarily the control mechanism put in place by the local AIDS control authority. However, Surat has a long way to go as it still tops the state with the highest number of HIV infected individuals. In Gujarat, there are 48,917 people suffering from HIV/AIDS of which 26,955 are male and 18,687 female. There are 2,975 children below the age of 15 years who are living with HIV/AIDS. In Surat alone, there are 9,998 people who are HIV positive (5,734 male and 3,785 female) with 479 children according to Gujarat State Network of People (GSNP) living with HIV/AIDS and state government. Dr Mukul Choksi, a psychiatrist who treats number of patients attributes the decline to fear factor and training of sex workers by NGOs and government. \"On one hand, we have fear among people be it educated or uneducated class. This has led to adoption of safe sex practices to larger extent. On the other hand, large number of sex workers have been trained to practice safe sex and it is being practised widely.\" A senior medical officer of Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in Surat said that improved services at ART centres and increased awareness has also led to fall in new infections. \"Once an infected patient is introduced to ART drugs, viral load of HIV goes down in his body and transmission risks decreases. This coupled with number of awareness campaigns and safe sex practices has started giving positive results and we hope it will serve its purpose in another 10 years,\" said Dr Alap Mehta, senior medical officer of Surat ART center. Daxa Patel, of GSNP said, \"It is good that new infections have come down, but we only hope that social taboos and social indignation that many AIDS/HIV patients face also comes down.\" Surat has maximum number of HIV positive patients due to its large migratory male labour population."

He met with a severe accident in the same year. \u201cI was hospitalised in a government hospital and discharged after 15 days But I started falling ill pretty often after that,\u201d says Gyan. AIDS, says Gyan, was probably developed there but he was unaware. Skin started becoming dead and blisteres developed. In the meantime, he donated blood for his friend. After 15 days of donation, he got a letter saying he should contact ART centre. \u201cI did not know about the ART centre. When I went there, the banners talking about AIDS made me realise what could be the impending disaster in my life,\u201d Gyan says. Both he and his wife gave samples. \u201cThe ground slipped beneath our feet when we got the report. Me and my wife went to complete oblivion for 15 days,\u201d he says while recounting his nightmare. They were advised not to bear kids. \u201cWe had earlier planned for a test tube baby since my wife had certain complications.

Following this, their medication started. Gyan wrapped up his business. In 2006, came the first high point. \u201cMy child was born and today he is six years old and leading a healthy life,\u201d says Gyan. However, he met with the first resistance when he decided to join an NGO working for the rights of AIDS patients. \u201cThey wondered about my finances. But I needed a reason to live.\u201d says Gyan Gyan is today the president of BNP. He has the support of Bihar State Aids Control Society, Plan India and other NGOs and \u201cmanages his salary on project basis.\u201d Today, his organisation has a total staff of 58 people, 80% of whom are HIV positive.

        "title": "Global funding dips by 90%, may cripple war on AIDS",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: International funds for India\u2019s National AIDS Control Programme have dried up severely, posing a serious threat of recurrence of new HIV cases. Estimates show a reduction of almost 90% in funding from various multilateral, bilateral and philanthropic donor organisations over the last three years, sources in the government as well as civil society said. While many multilateral organisations, including World Health Organisation (WHO) and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have either drastically scaled down or diverted funds from India\u2019s HIV control programme to other countries, bilateral and even philanthropic donor organisations like Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Clinton Health Access Initiative and World Vision have slashed funding to the national programme. This is expected to create pressure on the health ministry, which is already struggling with a truncated health budget to fund its various schemes. Instead of financing AIDS control programme, many of the organizations, mainly the bilateral and philanthropic donors, have shifted focus to management of other diseases such as tuberculosis and family planning, sources said. This has led to fears that India may again lose ground in controlling emergence of new HIV-infected cases as it is at a very crucial juncture at present. India, which has the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world, demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to the 2013-14 annual report of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). The trend of annual AIDS related deaths have also shown a steady decline since the rollout of the free Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) programme in India in 2004. Government estimates show around 1.5 lakh lives have been saved due to the programme till 2011. Experts say the achievement was a result of various interventions and scaling-up of prevention strategies under the National AIDS Control Programme. However, a slowdown in funding and resource crunch can cause a potential damage. \u201cThe overall international funding has come down by almost 90% in last three years. This is challenging because India has just about managed to achieve 90% and the rest 10% is critical as we need to sustain the decline in new cases for at least another seven to eight years,\u201d says Rajesh Kumar, vice chair of Global Fund\u2019s country coordinating mechanism-India. Kumar, who is also Executive Director at the Society for the Promotion of Youth and Masses, says the situation is unfortunate because there is already a low health care budget. At present, Global Fund and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are the two main organisations which are continuing with funding for AIDS control programme. Besides, the World Bank continues to fund such programmes through loans. According to Kumar, the withdrawal of funds by various multilateral organisations is also because of political decisions of both India as well as donor countries. While many of these organisations are short of funding, India\u2019s achievement in AIDS control has also led to many donor agencies diverting resources to areas where the need is more. For instance, Gates Foundation, which launched its AIDS prevention programme \u2018Avahan\u2019 in India in 2003 and was working with the government as well as NGOs and community groups, said in a note, \u201cBetween 2010 and 2012, the government gradually took ownership of the programme as planned.\u201d While the Foundation continues to support the government in HIV prevention, it is now more focused in other segments such as family planning, tuberculosis and sanitation."

The theme seeks to do away with HIV and AIDS discrimination in terms of self and social acceptance, access to HIV prevention and treatment services, education and employment opportunities as well as many other aspects of everyday life. \u201cHIV and AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refer to negative perceptions and attitudes, misconceptions, prejudice and abuse directed at people living with HIV. Despite the remarkable progress made in advancing HIV science, stigma and discrimination which is founded on the fear surrounding the early AIDS pandemic in the 1980s continues to persist to this day,\u201d says founder, Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are invariably devastating, he adds, stating that some people are shunned by family, friends, community and society, while others face poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, violation of their human rights, and psychological damage. \u201cThese push people living with HIV and key populations further underground, limiting their access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment and other lifesaving health services,\u201d he says. The contest is open to students of higher secondary schools and colleges affiliated to Goa Board and Goa University. The last date to submit the films November 20 by email- getintouch@humantouch.ngo.

        "body": "COIMBATORE: Since the first HIV case was detected in Tamil Nadu in 1986, it has been a 24x7 fight against the disease. The results are finally quantifiable\u2014the number of fresh cases has dropped more than 60% since 2010 in the state. Tamil Nadu recorded 26,089 fresh cases in 2010-11, which reduced to 9,892 in 2013. The sharp decrease in the number of cases follows increased awareness among people about screening and precautions, said experts. \u201cTamil Nadu has a strong health system which focused on meticulous screening for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 2010, around 1.8% of the state\u2019s average population was HIV+. It is now 0.25%,\u201d said Vijay Raman, deputy director, Voluntary Health Services, a non-profit multispecialty hospital in Chennai. The screening and monitoring of people with HIV has been stepped up in the last four years. \u201cThere are around 1,200 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in the state. The state government along with NGOs has reached villages for HIV screening,\u201d said A Bakthavatchalam, deputy director, Association for Rural Mass India, an NGO. The state government and NGOs introduced a number of schemes to reach more people. \u201cOne scheme was to adopt 100 villages and engage into one-to-one conversations with people. Based on the conversations, we would test them for HIV,\u201d said S Kalaiarasi, executive director, Swestic, an NGO that identifies and monitors people with HIV in five districts in Tamil Nadu. Kalairasi said awareness about methods of prevention has increased among risk-prone communities like the transgenders, homosexuals and sex workers. \u201cFive years ago, a sex worker, especially in rural areas, would agree to sex without protection. Today, most sex workers insist on condoms and sometimes even explain the reason to the customer,\u201d she said. Compulsory screening in certain areas has also helped reduce the number of cases. \u201cAn NGO would map a district based on the cases and list high-risk villages. In some cases, based on analysis, NGOs would insist on compulsory screening,\u201d said Bakthvatchalam. \u201cThis was to help people get medical attention if they were in the initial stages.\u201d Experts and NGOs attribute the higher screening rate to funding from and programmes by corporate and private bodies. \u201cOver the years, besides the central and state government efforts, we have seen corporates and private bodies organizing screening camps and awareness, especially in the southern states,\u201d said Raman. While Tamil Nadu is seeing sharp reduction in the number of fresh cases every year, the overall numbers are still high. The state has 80,685 HIV+ people, the fourth highest number in the country."

According to the PCR, the patient was admitted to hospital with complaints of infertility in 2013, and underwent a surgery for excision of fibroid in 2014. Prior to the operation, she underwent a couple of blood tests along with an HIV test, on the advise of the treating doctor. The report showed her to be HIV-negative. The patient alleged that after undergoing transfusion of one unit of packed blood cells from an unknown donor at the hospital during the surgery, she was reported to be HIV infected the following day. She has accused the hospital of committing gross medical negligence by violating the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guide lines and those of blood transfusion. The patient accused hospital authorities, the doctor concerned and the Integrating Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) department of tampering with medical records to cover up evidence of negligence by causing a patient to get HIV infection via blood transfusion. Dr Nandakishor V, chief blood bank in-charge at MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, said: \u201cThe patient was HIV-positive before the surgery and before the blood transfusion was done on her.We have all medical reports to prove that she was HIV-infected even before she underwent the blood transfusion.The donor was not infected and we haven't violated any rules of blood transfusion in her case.\u201c"

She continued her battle till the last minute,\" said a person closely associated with the doctor\u2019s family. She was aged above 70 years and is survived by her son Sunil Suhas Solomon. Dr Solomon, who belonged to the illustrious Gaitonde family, and her colleagues documented the first evidence of HIV infection in India in 1986 when she served as a professor of microbiology at Madras Medical College and Government General Hospital as a professor of microbiology. She also set up the first voluntary testing and counseling centre and an AIDS research group in Chennai. She held prestigious posts in various national organisations that worked for HIV positive people and was the principal investigator of several pioneering HIV research studies. These include the US National Institute of Mental Health's multi-country HIV/STD prevention trial and measuring stigma in health care settings in southern India. Her experience covered a wide range of aspects related to HIV infection, from biomedical to socio-economic. \"She dealt with science in the most honest manner and had a high sense of commitment for completion. We have lost a prolific and erudite scientist,\" said Dr S Sudnararaman, who worked with her in the 80s and 90s."

Not only is the incidence declining among the high risk groups, but also observed among the general population. Confirming this, officials from the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), Hyderabad, and District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Vizag, said the incidence has declined not only among the vulnerable high risk groups (HRG), MSMs (homosexual males) and injectible drug users (IDUs), but also among the general population, including pregnant women, that underwent tests for HIV. Incidentally this year\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) theme for World AIDS Day is \u2018Zindagi Zindabad\u2019 targeting zero stigma, zero new infections and zero AIDS deaths. \"Four-five years ago, out of 100 people who tested for HIV, three-four would test positive but now two people are testing positive out of every 100 undertaking HIV tests in the district. Also, more and more people are coming for getting tested. Similarly, 0.2 per cent pregnant woman are now testing positive for HIV, which was around 0.7 per cent 4-5 years ago. This prevalence is more in urban areas than rural and Agency areas,\" said Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (ADMHO, AIDS and leprosy). As for HRGs, new incidence of HIV has come down from 11 per cent to 7 per cent between 2008 and 2012, from 7 per cent to 3.75 per cent among the IDUs and a massive decline among MSMs \u2014 from 23 per cent to 10 per cent \u2014 all in the same time period. Overall, as per the latest statistics of undivided AP, the prevalence of HIV has fallen from 1.22 per cent to 0.77 per cent among the general population, which includes pregnant women as well, said T Kailashditya, joint director of Targeted Intervention (TI), APSACS. As per APSACS and NACO data, in undivided AP, there are around five lakh HIV positive people and though all the 23 districts fall under \u2018A\u2019 category, there are 10 priority districts where the incidence of HIV is the highest. Interestingly, most of these are coastal Andhra districts, including Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Prakasam, Krishna, apart from Anantapur in Rayalaseema. Three high priority Telangana districts include Warangal, Hyderabad and Karimnagar. \"The prevalence of HIV is more in coastal districts due to various activities that entail migration and support a floating population,\" said T Kailashditya. Coming to HIV statistics in Vizag, at present there are around 26,000 registered HIV-positive people, of which 11,000 patients are under anti-retroviral treatment (ART) while the remaining 15,000 don\u2019t require ART drugs yet as their CD4 count (a kind of white blood cell that indicates immunity level) is more than 350. Included in the 11,000 are also around 350 HIV positive children below 15 years who have been put under ART drugs, averred Dr Ramesh."

It was not on any valid grounds, but only because there was no advice from the advisory board under the Act. \"Though the government counsel reported that the process of putting in place the board had started long ago, it hadn't been constituted yet. In one such case, the chief justice had even gone to the extent of observing that it appeared to be the desire of the government to set all detainees free by not appointing the board.

        "body": "HYDERABAD: State prisons are turning into HIV hubs with a three-fold rise in the number of fresh HIV cases detected in various prisons this year. Figures collated by a state government body which works closely with HIV positive persons throws up the alarming fact: as against the 119 prisoner from across the state who tested positive for HIV in 2009, the count this year has touched 362 as on date. The period between April to August this year alone saw the number touch the 239 mark. Also, HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the average 100-120 prison deaths each year in the state. More alarming is the fact that these figures are only approximate. For, there is no mandatory HIV screening of prisoners at the time of admission and thus officials admit that they are not aware of HIV status of many inmates in various state prisons. \u201cSome persons consider HIV tests to be taboo and do not give their consent to be screened. Even though they belong to the high risk group, their status remains unknown,\u201d said R V Chandravadan, project director of AP state AIDS control society (APSACS). With rampant instances of men having sex with men (MSM) once they are secluded from mainstream society and confined to their barracks, this figure is a fair indicator of the vulnerability of other prisoners, which is now manifest in the form of diseases. \u201cA large number of them are presently suffering from genital ulcer disease (GUD) which results from having unnatural forms of sex. Once diagnosed with such diseases, they become ten times more susceptible to acquiring AIDS at a later date,\u201d said a medical practitioner who recently visited and interacted with medical officers of two central prisons in the state. With APSACS having introduced its \u2018Raksha\u2019 project in state prisons in February last year as part of which prisoners are screened and those carrying the HIV infection sent for treatment, the mechanism is presently in place. But no decision has been taken yet by the prison authorities to keep a check on the HIV positive count once APSACS concludes its intervention programme next year. \u201cHabitual offenders who keep coming back to prison for petty crimes often indulge in unsafe sex outside and have multiple partners thus posing a threat to other inmates,\u2019\u2019 said a prison superintendent."

        "body": "BALASORE: At a time when the state government and several private agencies are going all out to spread awareness about AIDS, an HIV positive youth in Balasore district is making their job easier by informing people in remote, rural places about the disease and coming to the help of HIV-affected people. Sanjay (name changed), a 35-year-old resident of Bahanaga area in the coastal Balasore district, has been on a mission for the last couple of years to spread awareness about various aspects of AIDS and the HIV virus. He has, in fact, become an icon for hundreds of AIDS affected people in the region. Apart from looking out for HIV positive people and helping them as and when required, he has been attending awareness workshops and campaigns in the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara. While on the occasion of World AIDS Day on December 1, government and private organizations were busy holding closed door meetings and seminars at upmarket hotels in the cities, Sanjay, who is attached to a non-government organization, was spreading awareness in remote villages. \"I have met more than 500 HIV patients during such programmes and interacted with them. I feel it is an opportunity for me to make people aware about the dos and don'ts of the disease. Even though I am an HIV patient, I have never felt ashamed. My aim is to make our society HIV free,\" he said. As there is social stigma attached to the disease, HIV positive people face censure and humiliation from villagers and even family members in remote villages. Through his mission, Sanjay has been trying to make them familiar with the life and problems faced by an AIDS or HIV-affected person. He visits hospitals, collects data about HIV positive people and meets them personally to enquire whether they are facing any problems. Life was good for Sanjay till he completed Plus II and left for Mumbai in 1998 to work in a private company. He unknowingly came in contact with an HIV positive person from whom he is believed to have been affected with the disease. He had to return home in 2011 after he was diagnosed to be HIV positive. \"I felt like the sky broke down on me. However, I tried to get over the trauma and got myself treated. My family supported me a lot to overcome the stress and stigma attached to the disease. Later, I came in contact with volunteers who taught me how to have the patience to lead life,\" he said. In awareness meetings, he appeals to people not to worry or feel ashamed of being HIV positive or suffering from AIDS. \"Just lead a normal life and live happily till the end of your days,\" he advises them, besides letting them know about various social security schemes launched by the government for HIV patients."

        "body": "PANAJI: The government will soon finalize a scheme to provide aids in the form of wheelchairs, hearing aids, etc to disabled persons in Goa to the tune of 1 lakh, chief minister Manohar Parrikar said on Monday. Parrikar was speaking at a function to hand over a special battery-driven motorized wheelchair to differently-able, Class VII youth Shreyas Totekar of Kendriya Vidhyalaya, Ponda. In the absence of a scheme now, the government sanctioned Totekar the amount for the wheelchair under the chief minister's relief fund. Parrikar said the new scheme will be drawn up by the social welfare department. Parrikar said the government will accept applications to sanction the amount on a case-to-case basis. Presently, there are smaller schemes in social welfare department but the new scheme will be a supplementary, umbrella scheme. Social welfare minister Mahadev Naik said there are about 20,000 differently-abled youth in Goa. Under the scheme, the government will provide 1 lakh to beneficiaries to procure aids like wheelchairs, hearing aids or any other tool or implement that will help to make the life of the disabled person better. The balance amount will have to be put in by the beneficiary."

        "title": "Barbers expose customers to HIV infection",
        "body": "AGRA: Even after spending crores in creating HIV and AIDS awareness, the precautions that must be taken against the deadly infection hinge on a razor\u2019s edge. A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside barbers in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C. Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers. Straight razors with open steel blades, also commonly known as cut-throats, were the most These roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor. \u201cI shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,\u201d said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station. This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors. The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, \u201cYe sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).\u201d He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him. Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients\u2019 relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, \u201cI clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,\u201d said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement. He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer. According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers. \u201cPrevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,\u201d said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College. He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as \u201cother\u201d reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV. \u201cThough barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,\u201d added Dr Singh. The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops. Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers. \u201cBut these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,\u201d added the CMO."

According to Vijay Nagar police, resident of Sundar Nagar, Ravi Parmar was alone and this could be a possible reason behind committing suicide. No suicide note has been recovered. On Monday, Ravi\u2019s neighbour went to meet him. When nobody opened the door he peeped from the window and found him hanging. He then informed the police. The police said that Ravi\u2019s parents had gone to Nagda town for some work. They had to return on Monday. Police are investigating the case. Youth held for harassing class IX girl: The \u2018We care for you cell\u2019 of Indore police on Monday arrested a 21-year-old youth who was harassing a class IX student girl since last five months. According to police, resident of Martand Nagar, Dinesh Solse had crush on the girl and was instating the victim for friendship. When the girl refused, the accused managed to get her mobile phone number and started sending her messages. Fed up with the harassment, the girl\u2019s mother lodged a complaint with the cell on Saturday after which police took the accused in custody. In charge of the cell, Soma Mailk said the accused has been handed over to the Rajendra Nagar police."

        "body": "VISAKHAPATNAM: It\u2019s a matter of concern that cases of HIV/AIDS are still being reported daily in the country as well as in the state. Worse, lack of a vigilant national policy on ART (anti-retroviral treatment) prescription is enhancing the risk of emergence of poly drug-resistant AIDS. On World Aids Day (December 1), medical experts point to the challenges associated with AIDS prevention and treatment. The theme of this year World Aids Day is \u2018Hands up for HIV prevention - leadership, commitment, impact\u2019. Renowned HIV/AIDS expert and Padmasri physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao said, \u201cIn India, as there\u2019s no strictly implemented vigilant national policy on ART (anti-retroviral treatment) prescription, a variety of doses are being administered by different physicians. And adding to the crisis, some quacks have gone to the extent of prescribing ART drugs as per their whims and fancies. Some patients having read a brand name of ART in newspapers go for self-medication; some other patients imitate prescriptions of other HIV-affected persons and go to the point of purchasing over-the-counter drugs. This problem has been accentuated due to poor vigilance by the government on drug sales. This sort of practice in the country has already been growing and may soon assume enormous proportions and lead to the emergence of poly drug-resistant AIDS. If corrective measures are not initiated soon, this problem may threaten the efficacy ART therapy.\u201d However, it has been proved that with ART drugs, the average life expectancy of AIDS patients has increased. Therefore, ART is a very important mode of treatment. \u201cAs a result of advanced researches in AIDS treatment, now, the patients can be given a substantial life while death can be postponed dramatically. The average life expectancy of AIDS patients on a quality treatment is around 71.5 years. It is also proved that starting Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) late would end up to 15 years reduced life expectancy. Therefore, it\u2019s recommended by WHO to start ART irrespective of CD4 count once a person is confirmed HIV positive. Recently, the efficacy of ART on reducing the risk of sexual transmission of HIV has been estimated to be more than 95 per cent. This component is going to play a vital role among discordant couples who are interested in having a child without HIV transmission. To prevent mother to child transmission, appropriately administering ART is universally accepted,\u201d added Dr Rao. The two Telugu-speaking states too report one of the highest instances of HIV/AIDS in India. According to the latest statistics, there are 1.85 lakh HIV positive cases in Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. In India, this is the highest incidence of HIV after Maharashtra, which has around 1.45 lakh cases. Another problem is that, even after three decades of its existence, treatment of HIV is still elusive for many positive patients in India and elsewhere. \u201cThough treatment of AIDS is extremely cost-effective when compared to cost of management of several other diseases such as heart, kidney, and liver, this is not yet well understood by the people in India. The best treatment for HIV/AIDS including the latest tests of diagnosis HIV genome, monitoring of CD4 counts, viral load, kidney functioning, liver functioning would cost around Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 only. Even this cost is a heavy burden for many patients due to which they avoid coming for treatment, aver doctors. Meanwhile, according to the medical and health department, in Vizag district, there has been a slight decrease in instances of HIV from last year (from 2.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent). \u201cCurrently, 29,455 people have been identified as HIV infected in the district, among which 12,551 are on ART drugs. Besides, 4,731 patients are being provided Rs 1,000 as monthly pension,\u201d said District Medical and Health officer (DMHO) Dr J Sarojini."

        "body": "HOUSTON: Aiming to increase global use of condoms as a way to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS, researchers including an Indian-American professor have developed a new non-latex condom which contains antioxidants and can kill the deadly virus even after breaking. Mahua Choudhery and her team of researchers at Texas A&M University have come up with the hydrogel condom which could help in the global fight against HIV. The condom is made of an elastic polymer called hydrogel, and includes plant-based antioxidants that have anti-HIV properties. Choudhury, assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center's Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, is t. \"We are not only making a novel material for condoms to prevent the HIV infection, but we are also aiming to eradicate this infection if possible,\" Choudhury, assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center's Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, said . \"Supercondom could help fight against HIV infection and may as well prevent unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases and If we succeed, it will revolutionize the HIV prevention initiative,\" said Choudhury, the lead researcher. Choudhury, who studied Molecular Biology, Biophysics and Genetics in India before getting her PhD in the US, has been researching diabetes and the obesity epidemic. She was one of 54 people awarded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's \"Grand Challenge in Global Health\" grant. This year's initiative asked winning recipients to create an affordable, latex-free condom to help battle the HIV epidemic, which is currently affecting 35 million people in the world. \"If you can make it really affordable, and really appealing, it could be a life-saving thing,\" Choudhury said. The condom material already exists as a water-based hydrogel for medical purposes such as contact lenses, researchers said. In addition to protecting against STDs and pregnancy, researchers enmeshed in the hydrogel design the antioxidant quercetin, which can prevent the replication of HIV and if the condom breaks, the quercetin would be released for additional protection. Researchers hope the condom will enjoy greater use and have a stronger effect at preventing the spread of HIV as the new design is more comfortable and also heightens sexual pleasure. The condom has already been created and now the only thing keeping it from going to market is an approval on its patent application. The researchers hope to test the condom within the next six months. Once released, the new condom will eventually be made available to everyone, including those in rural areas, where these types of resources are limited, Choudhury said. Since its outbreak in 1981, HIV virus has killed 39 million people."

These agencies are monitored by the National AIDS Control Organization, the nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in the country. On Monday, TOI reported that people with HIV in the city were having a tough time finding drugs for opportunistic infections. Immunity is low in people with HIV/AIDS, making them vulnerable to opportunistic infections such as TB, pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis. \"Whether there is a shortage of drugs and, if so, the reasons behind it will be known only after getting the report,\" Shetty said. \"The medicine stock report demanded by the state is expected in the next few days. If there are any lapses, the state will write to the authority concerned and rectify the issue.\" Health officials also said MDACS had invited tenders to overcome the drug shortage that are required for treatment of the opportunistic infections."

        "body": "NEW DELHI: Soon after K Prasad turned 70, his family noticed that he wouldn't respond when someone called or that he missed large parts of conversations. The doctor diagnosed mild hearing loss and suggested an aid, but the device turned out to be so clunky, noisy \u2014 \"I'd rather not hear at all than have that whistling in my ear\" \u2014 and hard to use, that it spent more time on the shelf than in his ear. And his family got used to shouting at him. Last year though, a doctor found him a discreet device that sits neatly in his ear, and he's adapted to it well. New models of hearing aids are nothing like the analogue equipment our grandparents might have worn. They have superior sound quality and are often as small as a fingernail. \"Earlier, most hearing aids were large and visible. The new ones fit in the inner canal and are almost invisible,\" says Dr J M Has, an ENT expert in Delhi. This is why people are now less hesitant about getting assistive devices, he adds. As lifespans get longer, people have to deal with age-related ailments such as hearing loss, which aren't life-threatening but do cut into the quality of life. But there is no need to suffer in silence. Dr Shalabh Sharma of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi explains that hearing aids work well for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. \"For profound hearing loss, cochlear implants are needed,\" he says. In addition to advanced age (people generally start hearing less by the time they turn 65), listening to loud music on earphones is another reason for the increase in incidence of hearing problems. Mumbai-based audiologist Devangi Dalal says digital aids are better because they can be customised to each user's requirement. \"These aids allow people to hear soft speech louder and ambient sounds softer. Effective noise compression is key to a good hearing aid,\" she adds. Digital aids come with mobile apps that help users get a better listening experience. You can talk on phone and watch your favorite programmes on TV by connecting your aids to it via an app. Even in a conference, a hearing impaired person sitting in the back row can hear clearly. Certain aids come with a mic, which when worn by the speaker can amplify sound without disturbing others. The same technology enables children with hearing impairment to attend a regular school. They can hear the teacher clearly and, therefore, don't need to attend a special school. The latest breakthrough in hearing aid technology is the use of artificial intelligence. Using AI, aids can remember and store different settings of sounds in different situations, and automatically switch to that setting on sensing those frequencies. For instance, explains Paritosh Arora, CEO, Widex India, you go to a movie theater and change the sound setting on your mobile app. Once you're out, the hearing aid senses that and automatically switches back to outdoor setting. \"In the next six months we are launching battery-free aids that will have portable chargers. You charge them for 10 seconds and they are good to use for 24 hours,\" says Arora adding that Widex sells six to seven lakh hearing aids in India every year. Their prices start at Rs 15,500 and go up to Rs 3 lakh and more. There are more innovations on the cards. Devinder Dadwal, marketing head GN Hearing India Pvt Ltd, which sells hearing aids under the brand name ReSound, says the company has recently introduced ReSound Linx Quattro, an aid which has a wider frequency range. \"Users can hear sounds better and understand their source. For example, if you are out for a morning run and there's a truck honking from behind, these aids will help you figure out how far the truck is and the direction of its sound. It also allows health care professionals to remotely adjust or tune hearing aids using a mobile app so that the user does not have to visit the clinic or hospital,\" says Dadwal. He adds that ReSound sells about 50,000 aids each year in India."

Though the prison authorities had referred the death of Amulbabu as a suicide, an inquiry by the revenue divisional officer (RDO) concluded it was a case of murder. The RDO had also recommended criminal as well as departmental action against all the prison personnel who were on duty 12 to two hours before the murder. Taking the RDO report as well as a consequent government order into account, Justice D Hariparanthaman directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 5.4 lakh within eight weeks. The state government had earlier expressed its unwillingness to pay anything beyond Rs 1 lakh, which had been paid as solatium to the victim's family. The Pulianthope police arrested Amulbabu in 2008 in connection with a criminal case. Initially lodged at Vellore Central Prison, he was shifted to Cuddalore Central Prison on July 14, 2009. On August 4, 2009, the jail authorities claimed that Amulbabu had sustained grievous injuries after hitting himself against the prison wall. However, a statutory probe by the RDO revealed that it was a case of murder. The present matter relates to a writ petition filed by Amulbabu's father T Palani of Patalam. His counsel, P Pugalenthi, sought adequate compensation for the victim's family in view of the findings of the magisterial probe. According to his plea, Justice Hariparanthaman said: \"In my view, Rs 1 lakh as granted by the state government is general in nature paid for all victims of police torture as provided under the relevant government order. The said amount could be adjusted against the amount payable as per law to Palani for the custodial death of his son\". For the purpose of arriving at a reasonable quantum of compensation, the judge resorted to the multiplier formula as per the Supreme Court rulings as well as provisions of Schedule II of the Motor Vehicle Act. He then directed the government to pay Rs 4.4 lakh to Amulbabu's family, as they had been paid Rs 1 lakh as solatium on August 10, 2011 itself."

According to Vijay Kumar, the nodal district officer of the AIDS programme run by the Haryana State AIDS Control Society, there are many reasons behind the figures. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t get tested because they don\u2019t want to wait for the long hours of testing (it takes around two hours for an HIV test). Others think they are not at much risk, and therefore drop out of the tests. We cannot force them as it is done only with their consent,\u201d he said. HIV infection can be caused through various means: sexual transmission, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and from mother to child. However, 90% of children with HIV contract it from their parents. According to doctors, a complete cure is possible if detection is early. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), its \u2018Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission\u2019 services cover only about 47% annual estimated pregnancies in India. In 2015-16, 12.7 million pregnant women accessed this service. A NACO report says the number of women who are counselled anyway covers only 47% of women, making the number of women who do not get tested significantly large. \u201cIn such a situation, complete elimination of HIV transmission from mother-to-child appears to be a distant possibility,\u201d it reads."

        "body": "PANAJI: In a blatant violation of confidentiality over the status of an HIV positive patient, Goa Medical College on Tuesday afternoon affixed a \u2018Universal Precaution\u2019 board on the patient\u2019s bed, causing much distress to the family besides casting stigma. The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patient\u2019s children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions. TimesViewDiscriminating against and victimising an HIV/AIDS patient is not only condemnable, it is also criminal. This single insensitive act by the state\u2019s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment. Under the central law that provides for stiff punishment against all actions that may lead to hostility against HIV patients, both, the person who ordered the placing of the board on the patient\u2019s bed and implementor, must be punished. Also, the state government must immediately see to it that all staffers of GMC, medical and otherwise, are apprised about the proper ethics to be followed in treating HIV patients and the consequences in case of failure to do so. \u201cThe doctors, nurses, attendants and even those who bring food and clean the patient know about the health status. It is clearly written in all the papers appended in the treatment file too. I can\u2019t understand why this board was put,\u201d a close relative of the patient said. \u201cThe hospital should be helping such people who may not live for long. If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away,\u201d she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed. \u201cThe staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patient\u2019s head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, won\u2019t they reveal the health status?\u201d she asked. \u201cEven the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. It\u2019s a big shame for us. I\u2019m going mad,\u201d she said. The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities. Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology. \u201cWe have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again,\u201d he told TOI. \u201cUniversal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patient\u2019s bed,\u201d CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said. \u201cThis is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings,\u201d Borges said."

Every month around 500 people visit the hospital's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC), which provides counselling and testing services, for check up and some of the patients are found HIV positive. \"In the month of November 2013, 490 people were tested and two were found HIV positive. In December, 7 persons were found HIV positive out of 559 people tested,\" said an official. Number of transgender visiting hospital for HIV test was reported 22 and 17 in November and December respectively. Dr Meena Mishra, chief medical superintendent, said that HIV tests are mandatory for surgical patients and also for pregnant women. \"The hospital has been providing free HIV tests and counselling to patients but it does provide the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) facility. Due to which the patients found HIV positive have been referred to either a medical college in Meerut or AIIMS, Delhi for medical dose.\" She said that the Link-ART facility is likely to be available for patients by the next month. The people infected with HIV will be treated by using anti-HIV drugs which suppresses HIV replication and they would not need to go far. Dr Rashmi, clinical psychologist at the hospital, said that due to massive awareness, male and female both come to the hospital in large numbers. \"Most people hesitate to clearly explain their problems to us. We first help the people about understanding sexually transmitted diseases. Then advise them to go for test. This is a major infection and may lead to more complications if not cured on time,\" she said. According to officials, once the Link-ART facility is started at the hospital, the patients will be provided medical doze at their doorstep. The hospital, in association with Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi, has been already been providing PAP Smear test to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes of the female reproductive system."

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Doctors are warning of a new sexually-transmitted superbug which they fear could ultimately prove to be even more deadly than AIDS. The antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhoea - now considered a superbug - was discovered in Japan two years ago. Experts have warned that the bacteria's effects could match those of AIDS. \"This might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,\" said Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine. Even though nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, Christianson believes the effect of the gonorrhoea bacteria is more direct, 'CNBC News' reported. \"Getting gonorrhoea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days. This is very dangerous,\" Christianson said. \"It's an emergency situation. As time moves on, it's getting more hazardous,\" said William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. This gonorrhoea strain, HO41, was discovered in Japan two years ago in a 31-year-old female sex worker who had been screened in 2009. Since it resists current antibiotic treatment, the strain has been placed in the superbug category with other resistant bacteria, such as MRSA and CRE. These superbugs kill about half the people they attack, and nearly one in 20 hospital patients become infected with one, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though no deaths from HO41 have been reported, efforts to combat it must continue, Smith said. \"We have to keep beating the drum on this. The potential for disaster is great,\" he said."

Insurers feel designing such a policy would involve intricate issues of premium, patient confidentiality and sustainability. A 21-year-old Ghatkopar youth, who has been on HIV treatment since eight years, welcomed the move. \u201cWith antiretroviral treatment, lifespan has increased. Those infected not only want to lead normal lives and have families but also secure their future,\u201d he said. The draft circular, issued this month, by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority on policies for people with HIV/ AIDS may come into effect from April 2014. The draft guidelines pondered over issues like cover for those who acquire HIV after the policy\u2019s commencement. About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV-infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. However, the insurers are worried about a majority of deaths in the younger age-groups. \u201cHIV-related mortality has come down but still affects the young age group,\u201d said Dr Alaka Deshpande, former head of JJ Hospital\u2019s ART centre."

        "body": "MUMBAI: Following years of protest, the Centre is set to roll out the viral load-testing for HIV/AIDS patients in the next six months across the country. The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of HIV virus in a patient\u2019s blood. The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory. In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible. \u201cFrom February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,\u201d said Dr R S Gupta of NACO\u2019s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city. Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee. \u201cThe body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It\u2019s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,\u201d said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body\u2019s immune system. \u201cBut it\u2019s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,\u201d said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year. \u201cBecause of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don\u2019t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,\u201d said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed."

Although the vaccine is most effective on young girls before their \u2018sexual debut\u2019, the doctors said it could be effective right until the age of 45. Now that is something most women don\u2019t know. The doctors answered many questions clearing the doubts of about a hundred women in the audience, a largely educated one. I can\u2019t even begin to understand the plight of the uneducated rural women who have no idea about cervical cancer. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for someone to take you to the doctor, whether it is for the vaccination or the yearly screening. Get up and do it yourself,\u201d said the doctors. Statistics show that one out of every four women affected by this kind of cancer is an Indian. It is now a bigger killer than breast cancer. \u2018Meri beti meri duty\u2019 said the initiative. However, it is also our duty to live for our betis and our whole family. So while you get your daughter vaccinated after she is nine, also get yourself vaccinated if you fall below the age of 45. \u201cYour family needs you and you have to take care of yourself\u201d said Parminder Saini. She is a pediatrician who got affected by cervical cancer. She fought it and is back to leading the life of a doctor. \u201cI want people not to feel sorry for me but want the affected to be inspired to fight this disease and the rest of the world to keep themselves healthy,\u201d she said. She talked about deleting stress from our lives as much as possible, pointing to the fact that it can be one of the main causes of cancer. Practices like yoga and meditation should be a part of daily life. \u201cEat healthy, focusing on fruits and vegetables,\u201d she said. \u201cLive your life and value it.\u201d So let\u2019s guard our special angels.

Meenakshi, who is in her 30s, and her organization, Kovai District HIV Nalla Sangam (CD HANS), have played an important role in encouraging HIV/AIDS-affected persons to come out and form a network to fight discrimination. \"HIV affected individuals face a lot of problems. We came out with this initiative so that the affected could have a space to share their common problems,\" she says. With seven people on board, they started CD HANS as a network of HIV infected people. \"Now there are around 2000 members in our network in the district\", she says. Today, the organization conducts peer group programmes, support group activities and other joint initiatives. She says that peer group programmes help patients reconcile with the issues related to the disease. \"When everyone hears each other's story, it helps them garner a lot of emotional support,\" she explains. HIV patients are at first put through a get together that happens twice a month. Then, they meet during alternate months. \"The frequent get-togethers will help people overcome the fears and myths associated. With anti-retroviral treatment (ART), an infected person can live a normal life for more than 30 years. Most would have panicked and lost hope of living after detecting themselves to be HIV infected. They find it a new birth\", she says. Meenakshi is proud that many have found new lives through her group. \"Fortunately, we have plenty of financial assistance programmes and other initiatives. Through self-help groups of the HIV affected, many have started their own initiatives.\" Meenakshi, who had to drop her studies at 9th standard, has since completed an MA in Sociology from Anna University. \"I did this to develop my counseling skills. Assistance and consoling from our part helps patients more than the effort of a normal counselor,\" she says.

While standard anti-TB drugs can cure most people of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, improper use of antibiotics has led to new strains of the bacterium resistant to the two most powerful medications, isoniazid and rifampicin. \u201cMulti-drug resistant TB is spreading rapidly in many parts of the world,\u201c said Vasu Nair, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery in the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy . \u201cThere is a tremendous need for new therapies, and we think our laboratory has developed a strong candidate that disrupts fundamental steps in the bacterium's reproduction process,\u201c said Nair, lead author of the study in the journal Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters. Just like other living organisms, the genetic information contained in M tuberculosis undergoes a complex process known as transcription in which the bacterial enzyme, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RNAP, produces TB RNA. This molecule is involved in processes that produce critical bacterial proteins that the organism needs to survive. Nair and his colleagues said they were surprised to discover through preliminary experiments that the compound also exhibited strong anti-HIV properties, opening the door for dual therapeutic applications. The risk for developing TB is between 26 and 31 times greater in people living with HIV than those without HIV infection."

In 2005, the 43-year-old autorickshaw driver from Thane was diagnosed as HIV positive, and two years ago, he was also diagnosed with a kidney failure. What ensued was months of suffering. Even as Ashok had to be put on dialysis, none of his family members would come forward to donate a kidney as he was HIV positive. \"Everybody was apprehensive about his condition. We did not even know that giving an organ to him would not affect our health,\" said Ashok's brother, Surya (name changed). \"Finally, I decided to donate my kidney to him,\" said his 53-year-old brother. But when this decision was made, it turned out that Surya could not give his brother the kidney after all. While Ashok's blood group was A negative, Surya's was B positive. It was then that the brothers registered for a kidney swap at the Apex Swap Transplant Registry (ASTR)-a government authorisation committee that provides a platform for kidney patients to find donors with matching blood groups in return of a donor of their own. \"Even within the ASTR, two other families refused to go for the kidney swap with the Damji brothers as Ashok was HIV positive. We were able to convince one couple, who said that it did not matter who they were giving the kidney to, as long as the donor giving the kidney to them was healthy,\" said Dr Rajesh Kumar, who conducted the swap transplants at L H Hiranandani Hospital on May 9. Nagina and Mahendra Singh, the couple who were in need of a kidney, were happy that the swap worked out well. \"When the doctor explained the situation to us, we understood that the HIV infection was not going to affect us. There was thus, no reason for us to refuse the swap,\" said Mahendra, who had also been on dialysis, but could not get a transplant as his blood group was B positive and his wife's was A positive. \"It was the first kidney swap for an HIV positive patient in the city,\" said Dr Kumar, adding that the complications of a transplant increase in such patients. \"The success rate is about 5% less in an HIV patient than a normal patient, as the risk of infection is more. Also, the drug interaction between the transplant medicine and the anti-retroviral therapy drugs also create complications,\" Dr Kumar added. Both Ashok and Mahendra are well on their way to recovery, while the donors have already been discharged from the hospital."

        "title": "HIV poses challenge in elimination of kala-azar",
        "body": "PATNA: The Centre and the state government have set the target of eliminating kala-azar, also known as Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in medical parlance, by 2015. However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are HIV positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world. The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%). It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science (PLOS) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too. These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, \u201cScreening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.\u201d Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, \u201cAs of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.\u201d There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, \u201cInstead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.\u201d His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS. The study, in fact, suggested that the number of follow-ups be more for HIV-VL cases than the VL ones."

        "body": "NAGPUR: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has constituted a three-member committee - headed by the professor and head of the department of biochemistry, Dr MG Muddeshwar - to look into the allegations of misappropriation of funds allocated by the National AIDS Control Organization to the regional centre of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Associate professor of microbiology, Dr Vijay Shegaonkar has been alleged for misappropriating the funds. The committee has already begun the investigation and the report is likely to be ready within 3-4 days. But despite formation of a new probe committee, majority of the GMCH staff is unhappy about the way the administration is dealing with the issue. They are suggesting an inquiry by a committee from outside the college to ensure transparency in the entire case. The professor and head of the microbiology department Dr NG Deogade had alleged serious irregularities and misappropriation of funds by Dr Shegaonkar. In fact, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), through which the funds are routed to the centre, has stripped Dr Shegaonkar from the in-charge post following allegations of misuse of funds. Sources in GMCH told TOI that the administration has asked Dr Deogade to explain in writing how the information reached the newspaper. They insisted that the chances of any substantial revelations from the probe are minimal. \"If there were faults in the expenses, MSACS or NACO should not have released the yearly allocation which is usually done only after the college submits a 'certificate of utilization'. Why didn't the authorities discontinue the funding if misuse was suspected,\" asked a senior teacher. A section of the teachers is also blaming the MSACS for not getting the annual audit. \"It is for the first time that an audit was conducted this year,\" a source revealed. These teachers are linking it to state level politics too. They say that MSACS wants to hijack the centre from GMCH to Mumbai. Vice dean and head of the forensic science department Dr PG Dixit and the college administrative officer Vilas Khangan are the two other members of the probe committee."

At 12 years, his curiosity and keenness to spend most of the time with his father led him to join this campaign. Jagjit Singh Mann, father of Tej, has been working on this social issue of discrimination against AIDS patients for the past eight years. \"When I used to leave my house for the AIDS awareness campaigns, Tej would ask me what I was doing outside, how we are working in the field to make people aware, and now he is here. He helps me in the field. Some of the causes and the sources of HIV AIDS, I really wanted him to know practically, for instance using repetitive syringes in the case of taking drugs, a menace in Punjab. Our main motive is to remove discrimination against these patients from society,\" he said. Mann is a government teacher at the Government Primary School (Girls), Mallha, near Jagraon. After his duty hours, and by taking leave, he works for this social cause. All the literature on AIDS has been taken from the godowns of the Punjab State AIDS Control Society (PSACS), where they were lying as if they were of no use. \"After many arguments with people at the PSACS centre, we brought this literature in gunny bags from there. Otherwise, they would have been sold to ragpickers. We wanted to take this to the people for whom it was made,\" he said. This year, Mann's NGO - Punjab Networking of Positive People Society - had started a campaign on World AIDS Day by travelling door-to-door to distribute pamphlets and talking to people about their HIV tests and sources of HIV, before taking them to ART centres. He started this campaign on Sunday, and will be continuing it for one week by moving around in his car and motorcycle decorated with AIDS posters. When he started this awareness programme, he had 10-12 members with him, but now feels proud that his son has also started showing curiosity about it. The campaign is going on in Ludhiana and SBS Nagar. \"I was talking to my colleague once, who was a bit worried about his friend in Rampur - a truck driver - suffering from HIV. The driver came to know about having AIDS in the last stage, as he had never heard about the disease. This left me shocked, and I decided to move ahead to spread awareness among youth and common people living away from the health systems in the state\", Jagjit Singh Mann, founder of NGO, Punjab Networking of Positive People Society. \"I am proud that my father is doing this. I joined him out of curiosity, and to spend more time with him. This awareness will be helpful to society where knowledge about AIDS is still very less,\" said Tej Pratap Singh, 12-year-old son of Jagjit Singh."

So we thought of utilizing it for TB as well.\u201d Once the helpline starts, judging by its response, the National AIDS Control Organization (Naco) can be requested to increase the existing strength of four counsellors, Pathak said. \u201cThe helpline will also counsel patients about the importance of going for TB testing if they test positive for HIV and vice versa.\u201d"

Through this regional strategy, WHO urged member countries to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care and to contribute to health- related millennium development goals (MDGs), particularly MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). To ensure this, primary healthcare needs to be revitalised, and health services integrated to strengthen links between HIV, TB, sexual, reproductive health and maternal and child health. The goals are guided by principles that include tackling the social determinants of health that drive the epidemic and also hinder the response; protecting human rights and promoting gender equality; and integrating HIV and other health services. A WHO official said countries must prioritise advocacy for reducing drug prices, train and sensitise health workers and minimise HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings. HIV testing and counselling needs to be decentralised to enable people to know their HIV status. The goals of the regional strategy are to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care. The second goal is to contribute to the achievement of millennium development goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) and other health-related goals (MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 8) and associated targets. WHO has four strategic directions to achieve the goals, one is to optimise HIV prevention, care and treatment. This includes preventing sexual transmission of HIV, eliminating congenital syphilis, access to safe blood transfusion, comprehensive and integrated services for sex workers, homosexuals, people who use drugs, young, displaced, mobile and migrant populations. The second direction is to strengthen strategic information systems for HIV research, as information on the various aspects of the issue is crucial in guiding policy and decision-making. The third is to strengthening health systems so that HIV services are part of other essential services that are available, accessible and affordable. The fourth direction is creating a supportive environment to ensure that everyone has equitable access to HIV services."

When she met the doctor on duty, Dr Lalsa Sinha, she was allegedly refused treatment because Manju was HIV positive. \"Tum yahan HIV faila dogi, jaldi jao yahan se (you would spread this deadly disease here, go away),\" the doctor allegedly shouted at Manju.When Manju's attendants argued with the doctor to get her admitted, the doctor allegedly got furious and asked the ward boy to throw the patient on road. \"I will not treat you and this is my decision,\" Manju quoted the doctor as saying. Since Manju is from economically backward family, she could not afford treatment at any private clinic or hospital. \"Mai nao mahine ki garbhwati hoon, pati driver hai. Paisa hai nahi, kahan jaun kya karoon kuch samajh main nahi aa raha hai (I am nine months pregnant, my husband is a driver. I have no money. Where would I go),\" Manju told this correspondent.However, medical officer Dr Ravi Ranjan said HIV is neither a fatal disease nor it spreads by contact. HIV patients can lead a normal life while taking timely medicine. He said nobody has the right to discriminate against HIV patients.When contacted, civil surgeon Dr Rampratap Singh said, \"We will look into the matter.\"He admitted that the hospital does not have sufficient resources to ensure normal delivery to HIV patients. It may be mentioned here that sadar hospital has earned a bad name in recent times because of alleged rude behaviour of doctors resulting in law and order problems."

They demanded that the department of AIDS control (DAC) increase VLT availability. The test is crucial to detecting the onset of AIDS. Networks affiliated to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) like the Manipur-based Community Network for Empowerment (Cone), a state-level network of people who use drugs, and Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) stated that the Manipur State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) is not doing enough to ensure availability of VLT. It also accused SACEP of falling prey to bureaucratic red tape and putting the lives of HIV positive people at risk. \"In Assam and Sikkim, samples are sent directly to the referral laboratory in Kolkata. However, HIV positive people in Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have to come to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal to give their blood samples. They have to wait a long time to get their results as well,\" said Leena Menghaney, campaign coordinator, MSF. According to recent guidelines of World Health Organization (WHO), HIV positive people who are on antiretroviral treatment(ART) need to get a VLT done annually to ensure correct treatment. Menghaney added that VLT accessibility in some African countries was better than in India. Citing an example of an HIV positive Manipuri girl who lost her life while waiting for a VLT, community members of PLHIV expressed that treatment monitoring was a necessity. \"HIV positive people in the region, whose first line of treatment had failed, could die waiting for access to VLT to confirm treatment failure. We want DAC to respond to the situation here and ensure that patients do not face unnecessary delays in their clinical assessment,\" said Rakjumar Nalinkanta, president, CONE. Till July 2013, Mizoram had 8,258 HIV positive people, with 2,556 patients on ART, 12 patients on second line treatment, and 14 people waiting for VLT. Two people died last year in December while waiting for VLT. In Manipur, there are more than 40,000 HIV positive people. VLT determines the success of ART. There are VLT machines in Manipur, Assam and Megahalya but they are not recognized by NACO. Viral Load Test measures the number of copies of HIV'S genetic material (RNA) in every millilitre of blood. A person's viral load is undetectable when there are less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood, implying that the virus has been suppressed. The test prevents patients from being given more expensive drugs by doctors. However, owing to its high price of VRL, a patient's CD4 white blood cells are still used to monitor a patient's response to treatment."

        "body": "KOLKATA: The city showed its absolute apathy and lack of sensitivity towards the 'third sex' recently when a HIV-positive eunuch had to go back without getting treatment from a government hospital. Heena (name changed to protect identity), who was suffering from urinary tract infection was taken to SSKM Hospital on September 2. After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks. Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB). After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission. \"We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,\" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha. Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning. In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station. \"Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient. They were pained by the way Heena was suffering. They lamented that they had no place in the society, even in hospitals. Despite our plea to wait for another day, they took Heena away,\" said Sinha. Heena is probably getting 'treatment' right now from quacks somewhere in Bihar. None from SSKM wanted to comment on the allegation. Dr D N Goswami, joint director (TI), who was constantly informed about the problem, also refused to comment saying that he was busy in a meeting. Other WBSAPCS officials, however, said they would look into the issue. \"I had no knowledge about this. This should not have happened. Despite our effort to create awareness and sensitivity, there is still room for improvement. We will take up the issue once we get a complaint on it,\" said Dr Himadri Shekhar Sanyal, additional project director, WBSAPCS."

        "title": "Breaking the news to children living with HIV: a non-profit takes the lead in Ecuador",
        "body": "GUAYAQUIL: Jean's book of heroes occupies pride of place at a clinic run by Fundacion VIHDA, a non-profit working to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil. One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother. Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme. Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes. \"A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,\" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA. Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. \"We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,\" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network. Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. \"Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,\" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV. The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. \"Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,\" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. \"Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,\" says Zambrano. At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. \"The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,\" says Ortiz. From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18.

        "body": "AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has sought explanation from various state and central agencies in connection with the incident where 23 thalassaemic children in Junagadh district were tested HIV positive in the last one year due to transfusion of infected blood. Acting on a PIL filed by advocate Girish Das demanding investigation into the issue and compensation for the affected, a division bench has asked the additional secretary of National Aids Control Organisation, Drug Controller of India, director of Gujarat State Council for Blood Transfusion, the state health department and Junagadh police to file their replies within a month. Das has alleged that the children contracted the deadly virus due to criminal negligence on part of administration and demanded that the culprits be booked. He has sought a thorough investigation and demanded compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each kid tested HIV positive. Those tested HIV positive are among 100 thalassaemic children from Junagadh district, who have been coming to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. The patients arrange for the blood and the hospital does the transfusion. Thalassaemia is a hereditary blood disorder which results in excessive destruction of red blood cells leading to anaemia. Hence, thalassaemics need regular blood transfusions to stay alive. There are more than 4,500 thalassaemic children in the state."

        "body": "CHENNAI: If you were sharing a bus journey with Sundari, you would probably exchange a smile and ask where she shopped for saris or discuss children and their education. With her smiling eyes and cheerful face, she is the last person to fit into your idea of a person diagnosed as HIV positive. Or that four years ago, she withdrew from society and went into depression. \"My children are studying now and I will always be there for them,\" she says. Sundari was among 50 HIV positive people who turned up to watch the Tamil version of AIDS jaago,' an anthology of four short films on HIV-AIDS on Thursday. For all of them, it has been a journey to hell and back, \"specially since family members do not know how to deal with it and society marginalises us,\" as one of them said. To break the stigma and discrimination, leading filmmakers had made the short films, commissioned by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Vishal Bharadwaj's Blood Brothers' showcases two HIV positive men dealing the condition in diametrically opposite ways, while Mira Nair's Migration' meshes in a gay man trapped in a marriage with a migrant labourer's casual sex transmitting the virus. Both the films won rounds of applause. Equally appreciated where Farhan Akhtar's Positive' depicting the struggle between a father with full blown AIDS and his angry son. It was, however, Santosh Sivan's Prarambh' that got the standing ovation. Starring Prabhu Deva and Saroja Devi, the 12-minute film is a touching story of a child going in search of his AIDS-afflicted mother, for which reason also he is dismissed from school. \"The films are our biographies,\" said Gopi, a HIV-positive transgender. The mood turned sombre, but Dr R Lakshmibai, project director TAI, brought them out of it by singing the lilting Unnai kandu naan ada' from the film Kalyana Parisu'. \"There is a lot of stigma attached to HIV. We need more openness and awareness,\" said VHS secretary Dr ES Krishnamurthy, who has worked with HIV projects for 15 years."

        "body": "Ranchi: A recent survey by the Jharkhand State Aids Control Society (JSACS), the monitoring agency for HIV in the state, revealed that Ranchi, Dhanbad, Jamshedpur and Giridih districts have recorded more than 100 new HIV cases during 2015-16. The survey findings were released to the media on Friday.The state's mining and industrial pockets areas continue to record high prevalence of HIV cases despite numerous government intervention schemes.The findings, which are based on screening camps and integrated counseling and testing centres (ICTC) in 23 districts (excluding Garhwa), have recorded 1,496 positive cases in the past year. Of them, around 1,035 cases have been documented in the five districts. Ranchi has recorded 264 new cases, while Dhanbad has witnessed 114. East Singbhum district, including Jamshedpur, has recorded 188 new cases. Giridih has recorded 125 new HIV cases while Palamu has 132. However, Hazaribag has the most number of cases with 344 new infections in 2015. The survey is based on the screening of at least 1.07 lakh people, including priority groups such as sex workers, truck drivers and migrant workers, JSACS said. Dr Shami Akhtar, state programme officer for intervention in JSACS, said the number of new cases have recorded a marginal fall (0.02%) from 2014-15. During 2014-15, 1,645 new HIV infections were reported statewide. While Ranchi recorded 315 new infections during that period, Hazaribag remained the most affected with 463 positive cases out of 17,000 people screened. While the body attributed most of the new infections to migrant workers who were screened on their return home during festivals, JSACS suspects a larger number of unidentified HIV patients. \"The numbers can be anywhere between 30,000 to 36, 000 people,\" Akhtar said. According to National Aids Control Organization (NACO) statistics of 2013-14, Jharkhand has over 18,000 HIV positive patients. \"Migration is an issue which is beyond our control. We can only monitor the migrants' health,\" Akhtar added. These statistics come amid a host of intervention programmes being organized by the state health, education and family welfare department with assistance from the Centre, which includes providing condoms at subsidized rates from counters under the National Aids Control Program (NACP). A senior JSACS official said they are getting in touch with coal majors and other public sector units to set up condom vending machines for truckers and miners in mining areas and highways."

        "body": "PANJIM : About 74 employees of the Goa state aids control society (GSACS ), including doctors, counselors, clerical staff and lab technicians, all working on contract basis, will join the AIDS employees national committee of India, in their indefinite strike beginning on April 25 for regularization of their service. Their demand is also for a better pay package and to be treated on par with other medical staff working in other faculties. Some technicians and counselors complained that though they work regular hours, they do not get the benefits that are given to other medical staff. A counselor draws a salary of 12,000 whereas other clerical staff earn nothing not more than 10,000 a month. An officer who is attached to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) center at the Goa medical college (GMC), said that there has been a ceiling on his salary for the last two years. He earns 10,000 a month, and has no hope of an increment. \"We don't get any benefits, not even medical benefits,\" he said. The employees have already communicated their decision to go on indefinite strike (along with other employees of the aids control societies in the country) to the chief minister's office. Dr Vanda Viegas, senior medical officer, said she has been with the ART centre since April 2005, and said that on any given day, the ART centre handles 100-120 cases, but the government has not created a regular post. About 6,000 HIV patients are registered with the ART centre. The proposal for the creation of the post of senior medical officer has been pending for a long time now. \"A file has just come from the public health department enquiring about whether the post is needed,\" said Viegas. As part of the agitation, GSACS employees have started tying black ribbons on their arms. The GSACS comes under the domain of the national aids control society."

        "title": "Once-daily Quad pill found to be safer than ART regimens for HIV patients",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: A new once-daily pill combining three antiretrovirals (ARTs) and a booster molecule has been found to be safe and effective alternative to two widely used drug regimens for newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults, who have had no previous treatment. The findings of two large international randomized trials to be published on Friday's Lancet says the new \"Quad\" pill is faster acting, doesn't have the neuropsychiatric side-effects associated with other combinations, and could improve compliance with treatment. Patient adherence to medication is vital, especially for patients with HIV, where missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to medication. Older HIV treatment regimens involve taking several pills multiple times a day. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, lead author of the first study, said, \"Our results provide an additional highly potent, well-tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill.\" Sax said studies have shown that single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance. The first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens \u2014 either Quad, combining the new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (a new pharmacoenhancer COBI) plus FTC/TDF, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, combining EFV/FTC/TDF (also known as Atripla). After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies per mL of blood), compared with 84% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. Adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups. Mild nausea was more common with Quad, but patients were less likely to have dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and rash compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen. The second trial included 708 treatment-na\u00efve adults from 146 medical centres across Australia, Europe, North America and Thailand. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily Quad or a popular and recommended twice-daily combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/RTV) plus FTC/TDF. The primary endpoint, to achieve viral levels below 50 copies per mL of blood by week 48, was reached by 90% of people in the Quad group compared with 87% in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. The safety of the two regimens was also similar with only 3.7% of patients stopping treatment in the Quad group and 5.1% of patients in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. If approved by regulatory agencies, the Quad would be the first once-daily single-tablet regimen containing an HIV integrase inhibitor. Administration of multiple pills and management of additional prescriptions increases complexity, costs for patients, and the chances of poor or partial adherence. For regimens of the same efficacy, total pill burden and dosing frequency are some of the most significant obstacles to achieving high adherence. \"The EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen is undergoing regulatory review; if approved, it would provide an important new treatment option as the only once-daily, integrase-inhibitor-based, single-tablet regimen for initial treatment of patients with HIV,\" the study added."
